  <h1>Introduction to GPIOs</h1>

  <p>In our earlier projects, we wrote some basic code to print text to our
  Program Output window and we built some simple circuits to light up an LED.
  While doing these types of projects is important to learn the basics of
  programming and electronics, the purpose of this kit — and the part of
  programming and electronics that's really fun and interesting — is getting
  your code and your electronics to work together.</p>

  <p>We like to describe it as <i>using your code to bring your circuits to
  life!</i></p>
  <h2>What are GPIOs?</h2>

  <p>One of the most common ways for code and circuits to work together is
  through General Purpose Inputs &amp; Outputs (GPIOs).</p>

  <p>GPIOs are specific pins (little metal "legs" on the bottom or sides of a
  computer chip) that provide a way for the computer processor to communicate
  with the outside world (your circuits) and provide a way for the outside
  world to communicate with the code running on your computer processor.</p>

  <p>On the Raspberry Pi, there are 26 GPIO pins. They are indicated
  here (in red boxes):</p><img style="width: 300px;" alt="" src="img/pi_gpio.jpg">

  <p>Just like with power and ground back in the <a data-uid="rpipower"></a>
  project, we make all the GPIOs available on the Ready Set STEM kit through
  the Lid Connector Board. The pins you see here with numeric values (2-27) are
  the GPIO pins, and they are referenced by their number (for example,
  "GPIO18"):</p><img style="width: 200px;" alt="" src="img/lid_gpio.jpg">

  <p>If you wanted to hook up a component to GPIO18, you'd insert a wire from
  the component to the hole on the Lid Connector Board labeled "18".</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    GPIOs Are Part of the Raspberry Pi
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>The Lid Connector Board was designed to make connecting to the Raspberry
    Pi pins cleaner and easier. In fact, the whole purpose of the ribbon cable
    and the Lid Connector Board is simply to bring the GPIO pins (and other
    pins) from the Raspberry Pi to the Ready Set STEM Lid, where they are
    easier for you to attach your components.</p>

    <p>But, if you had a Raspberry Pi computer without the Ready Set STEM
    CREATOR Kit, you'd still be able to access the Raspberry Pi GPIOs.
    The GPIOs are made available through the pins on the Raspberry Pi (the pins
    that the ribbon cable is attached to). If you were to remove the ribbon
    cable, you could connect wires directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins and
    attach them to your components directly.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>There are two ways that a GPIO can be used: 1. As an <i>Output</i> or 2.
  As in <i>Input</i>. The rest of this concept (and the following project) will
  focus on using GPIOs as Outputs; in our next concept, we'll discuss using
  GPIOs as Inputs.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>GPIOs as Outputs</h1>

  <p>As mentioned above, GPIOs are a great way for your computer code to
  control your circuits. The most common use for having your code control your
  circuit is to turn components on and off (like an LED or any other device
  that can turn on/off).</p>

  <p>When a GPIO is used to allow our software to control our circuit, we say
  that we're "using the GPIO as an output":</p><img style="width: 450px;" alt=
  "" src="img/gpio_output.jpg">

  <p>Your code uses GPIO Outputs to control circuits in a very simple way — at
  any given time your code tells a GPIO pin to set its voltage <i>low</i>
  (meaning to 0V) or set its voltage <i>high</i> (meaning to 3.3V). By
  controlling whether a GPIO voltage is set low or high, your software can
  force your circuit to do something (or perhaps <i>not</i> do something, if
  that's what you prefer).</p>

  <p>To understand this concept, we'll need to think back to a previous
  discussion about how and why electric current flows through a circuit. If you
  recall from our earlier discussion in <a data-uid="electronics"></a>,
  electric current will only flow through a circuit when there is a voltage
  difference between the beginning and the end of the circuit.</p>

  <p>This is why, for our basic LED circuit, the LED will illuminate when we
  attach one side of the circuit to 3.3V power and the other side to ground.
  Like this:</p><img style="width: 150px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png">

  <p>Given that, it should also make sense that, if there is no voltage
  difference between the beginning and the end of a circuit, no current will
  flow. For example, imagine our circuit above, but instead of attaching the
  end of the circuit to ground, we attach it to 3.3V power, just like the
  beginning of the circuit.</p>

  <p>The circuit would look like this:</p><img style="width: 150px;" alt=""
  src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO-as-Power.png">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The symbol at the bottom of the image above is just
  another way to indicate power in a schematic — this is how power is typically
  represented when it's at the bottom of a circuit.</p>

  <p>As you can probably guess, in the circuit above, no current would flow
  through and the LED would not illuminate.</p>

  <p>Now, imagine that we wire a circuit — similar to above — but where the
  bottom of the circuit has a switch. And, that switch can be toggled between
  connecting to power and connecting to ground:</p>
  <table class="basic">
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 180px;" alt="" src=
     "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO-as-Switch-to-Power.png"></td>
     <td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 180px;" alt="" src=
     "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO-as-Switch-to-Ground.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><strong>GPIO Attached
     to Power (LED Off)</strong></td>
     <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><strong>GPIO Attached
     to Ground (LED On)</strong></td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Based on what we discussed earlier, it should be clear that when the
  circuit is configured like the left-hand circuit above, no current is flowing
  and the LED does not illuminate. But, when the circuit is configured like the
  right-hand circuit above, current will flow and the LED will illuminate.</p>

  <p>This is conceptually how a GPIO works. Using software, we can set the GPIO
  to either power or ground.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is no mechanical switch inside a GPIO — the
  above is just a <i>model</i> of how a GPIO works.</p>

  <p>Here is a schematic representation of a GPIO within a
  circuit:</p><img style="width: 300px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-to-GPIO.png">
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    "Active Low"
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>In the electronics world, we often use the term "low" to refer to
    ground. You might hear an engineer say something like, "Tie that component
    low," or "Set that pin low." That simply means to connect the component/pin
    to ground.</p>

    <p>It's interesting — and sometimes confusing — to think about the fact
    that in the circuits above, when the GPIO is set low (attached to ground),
    current is flowing and the LED is illuminated. And when the GPIO is set
    high (attached to power), current stops flowing. We tend to think of
    current flowing when it's attached to power, not ground. But remember, the
    other side of the circuit is still attached to power, and it's the voltage
    difference that creates current flow.</p>

    <p>This is why you'll sometimes hear engineers use the term "Active Low."
    It indicates that the GPIO needs to be set low (to ground) for the circuit
    to be active (turned on).</p>

    <p>Finally, the opposite of "Active Low" is "Active High." Engineers design
    chips and circuits in different ways depending on how they want their
    devices to work. While the LED circuits we use work as Active Low, you may
    encounter Active High circuits elsewhere.</p>
