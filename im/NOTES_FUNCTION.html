  <h1>Making Notes</h1>

  <p>Songs are made up of sequences of notes (or combinations of multiple
  notes). The Ready Set STEM API provides a <code>Note()</code> function that
  will create notes of different pitches.</p>

  <p>The basic use of the <code>Note()</code> function is to create a note:</p>
  <pre>
Note(<i>pitch</i>)
</pre>

  <p>where <code><i>pitch</i></code> can be either a number (which represents
  the frequency of the pitch), or a letter (A though G, the name of the
  note).</p>

  <p>For example, an 'A' note (above middle 'C') has the frequency of 440Hz (Hz
  is a unit of frequency — it is how many times something happens each second).
  So, to create an 'A' note you have two choices:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
a_note = Note('A')
another_a_note = Note(440)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Both <code>a_note</code> and <code>another_a_note</code> are equivalent.
  But, we still haven't played anything yet — we've just created the note we
  are going to play.</p>

  <p>If you've played an instrument, you know there are more notes than just A
  through G. For one, each note can be played a half-step up ("sharp") or down
  ("flat"). To specify sharps or flats with the <code>Note()</code> function,
  append a '#' to your note for a sharp, or 'b' for a flat.</p>

  <p>For example, to create a B sharp and a B flat, we could do this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_b_sharp = Note('B#')
my_b_flat = Note('Bb')
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>And there's octaves, too! To specify the octave, append a single digit to
  the very end of your note. By default, the octave is the fourth octave. One
  octave higher would be the fifth octave, one octave lower would be the
  third.</p>

  <p>For example, some more ways to specify an 'A':</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
a_note = Note('A')
the_same_a_note = Note('A4')
an_octave_higher_a_note = Note('A5')
an_octave_lower_a_note = Note('A3')
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Finally, you can combine sharps or flats with octaves, as in: 'Ab4',
  'B#6', or 'Db7'</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Making Music</h1>

  <p>To play notes, as in the previous project, you'll use the play function,
  which by default plays a note for one second. For example:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
note = Note('A')
note.play()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Try the above if you want, and you'll be disappointed to find your note
  doesn't play. The reason is that <code>play()</code> just <i>starts</i>
  playing a note, in the background. After starting playing, the program will
  continue to run — but in our program above, there's no more code after line
  3, so the program ends. The program actually ends before we hear the note
  playing, so we don't hear anything.</p>

  <p>This is why we typically use a <code>wait()</code> to force our program to
  wait for the note to finish. For example here we've added a wait:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
note = Note('A')
note.play()
*note.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Note that the <code>wait()</code> above essentially just waits for one
  second; if you preferred, you could have used a <code>sleep(1)</code> to
  accomplish nearly the same thing.</p>

  <p>Playing your own song would involve a sequence of playing notes of
  different durations and waiting for them to finish playing. In addition, a
  <code>time.sleep()</code> can be be used as a silence between notes. To
  change the duration that a note plays, you use the <code>duration</code>
  parameter, to set the seconds to play, as we did in <a data-uid=
  "playingnotes"></a>. But, you also can play a note <i>forever</i> by
  specifying the <code>duration=None</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, what if you want to stop a note early? When writing a game, you
  might want to start a note when something happens (say a button is pressed)
  and then stop it when the button is released. To stop it, you'd use the
  <code>stop()</code> function.</p>

  <p>Here is an example:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
import time
note = Note('A')
note.play(duration=None)
*time.sleep(2)
note.stop()
*time.sleep(2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>There are 2 sleeps highlighted in the code above:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>During the first sleep, the note is started playing</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>During the second sleep, the note is already stopped — but we want to
    prove that we forced the note to stop, not that the note stopped because
    the program ended</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>So, in the above code, the note plays for two seconds, there are two
  seconds of silence, and then the program ends.</p>
 </div>
</body>
