  <h1>Making Notes</h1>

  <p>Songs are made up of sequences of notes (or combinations of multiple
  notes). The Ready Set STEM API provides a <code>Note()</code> function to
  create notes of different pitches.</p>

  <p>The basic use of the <code>Note()</code> function is to create a note
  with:</p>
  <pre>
Note(<i>pitch</i>)
</pre>

  <p>where <code><i>pitch</i></code> can be either a number which represents
  the frequency of the pitch, or a letter A though G which is the name of the
  note.</p>

  <p>For example, an 'A' note (above middle 'C') has the frequency of 440Hz (Hz
  is a unit of frequency - it is how many times something happens each second).
  So create an 'A' note you have two choices:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
a_note = Note('A')
another_a_note = Note(440)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Both <code>a_note</code> and <code>another_a_note</code> are equivalent.
  But, we still haven't played anything yet - we've just created the note we
  are going to play.</p>

  <p>If you've played an instrument, you know there are more notes than just A
  through G. For one, each note can be played a half-step up ("sharp") or down
  ("flat"). To specify sharps or flats with the <code>Note()</code> function,
  append a '#' to your note for a sharp, or 'b' for a flat. For example, to
  create a B flat, use:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_b_flat = Note('Bb')
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>And there's octaves, too! To specify the octave, append a single digit to
  the very end of your note. By default, the octave is the fourth octave. One
  octave higher would be the fifth octave, one octave lower would be the third.
  For example, some more ways to specify an 'A':</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
a_note = Note('A')
the_same_a_note = Note('A4')
an_octave_higher_a_note = Note('A5')
an_octave_lower_a_note = Note('A5')
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Finally, you can combine sharps or flats with octaves, as in: 'Ab4',
  'B#6', or 'Db7'</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Making Music</h1>

  <p>To play notes, as in the previous project, you'll use the play function,
  which by default plays a note for one second. For example:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
note = Note('A')
note.play()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Try the above if you want, and you'll be dissapointed to find your note
  doesn't play. The reason is that <code>play()</code> just <i>starts</i>
  playing a note, in the background. After starting it, the program will
  continue to run - but in our program above, there's no more code after line
  3, so the program ends. The note will stop playing if you tell it to, or if
  the program ends.</p>

  <p>What you normally want to do is <code>wait()</code> for the note to
  finish. For example here we've added a wait:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
note = Note('A')
note.play()
*note.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>And because the <code>wait()</code> above waits for one second, you could
  also just pause for one second if you wanted, for about the same result, by
  changing the wait to a <code>time.sleep(1)</code>.</p>

  <p>Playing your own song would involve a sequence of playing notes of
  different durations and waiting for them to finish playing. In addition, a
  <code>time.sleep()</code> can be be used as a silence between notes. To
  change the duration that a note plays, you use the <code>duration</code>
  parameter, to set the seconds to play, as we did in <a data-uid=
  "playingnotes"></a>. But, you also can play a note <i>forever</i> by
  specifying the <code>duration=None</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, what if you want to stop a note early? When writing a game, you
  might want to start a note when something happens (say a button is pressed)
  and then stop it when the button is released. To stop it, you'd use the
  <code>stop()</code> function. For example:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Note
import time
note = Note('A')
note.play(duration=None)
*time.sleep(2)
note.stop()
*time.sleep(2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>There are 2 sleeps highlighted in the code above:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>During the first sleep, the note has started playing, and won't stop
    until we stop it or the program ends...</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>During the second sleep, the note was just stopped - so wait for two
    more second just to prove it really stopped!</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>So, in the above code, the note plays for two seconds, there are two
  seconds of silence, and then the program ends.</p>
 </div>
</body>
