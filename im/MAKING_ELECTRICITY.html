  <h1>How Electricity is Made</h1>

  <p>In our previous projects, we used a battery to power our circuits.
  Batteries play a critical part in powering our everyday devices, from mobile
  phones and laptops, to watches and hearing aids. Batteries are a common
  source of power for many electronic devices, but it's certainly not the only
  option for electrical power.</p>

  <p>Most of the electrical energy we use in our everyday lives comes from the
  power company. This electrical energy is readily available to us through
  electrical outlets around our homes &mdash; it heats our houses, runs our
  computers, cooks our food, lights our rooms, recharges our batteries, and so
  much more... But, where does the energy to do this come from, and how does it
  get to our homes?</p>

  <p>There are a number of different ways that the power company provides
  electric power, but the most common way is through an electric generator. A
  generator is a device that converts mechanical energy (movement) into
  electrical energy. When everything is set up properly, all you need to do to
  generate electrical energy is to provide the mechanical energy to turn the
  generator. For example, if you actually turn a generator by hand, then
  <i>you</i> can generate electrical energy.</p>

  <p>One thing to remember, though &mdash; electrical energy is never "made" out of
  thin air. The energy already exists &mdash; we simply convert other forms of energy
  (like the energy you use to turn the generator) into electrical energy.</p>

  <p><mark>PIC: hand cranked electrical energy</mark></p>

  <p>As you might imagine, power companies don't actually have people turning
  cranks on a generator all day to generate power. So, exactly how do they do
  it? That's where magnets come into play...</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Funky magnets. How do they work?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>It turns out that magnetic forces and electricity and are two very related
    concepts &mdash; either one can be used to create the other. If you put a magnet near
	a conductor and move it around, it will generate an electric current; and likewise,
    an electric current moving through a conductor creates a magnetic pulling force.</p>

    <p>This is the principle used by the power companies in their electric
    generators. By repeatedly moving a magnet within a closed loop of
    conducting wire (or moving the wire around the magnet), a current is
    generated in the loop.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that the reverse is true as well: an electric current flowing through
	a conductor that's near a magnet will pull the magnet (since the electric current creates a
    magnetic pulling force). This is how an electric <i>motor</i> works &mdash; a
    current in a loop of wire causes a magnet to turn. This is good to
    understand, as electric motors are used everywhere &mdash; they spin washing
    machines, they run air conditioners and refrigerators, they pump water, and
    they even turn the wheels on electric vehicles.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now that you know that power companies create electric current by rotating a
  magnet around a loop of wire (or a loop of wire around a magnet), you may be
  wondering how the magnet (or the wire) is rotated? This is generally
  accomplished by pushing steam through a turbine (which is basically a large
  fan with many fan blades) &mdash; the steam pushes the blades of the turbine,
  which turns the shaft of the generator, which moves the magnet (or wire) to
  generate electrical energy.</p>

  <p>Which leads us to our next question &mdash; how do you generate steam? To
  generate steam, we need to boil water. This can be done in one of many
  ways:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>We can burn something to heat the water. In the United States, this is
    the primary way generating electrical energy and typically the thing that
    we burn is coal (and sometimes natural gas). This is why you will often
    hear that coal is used to generate electricity.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We can use nuclear energy. Nuclear reactors use a process of "splitting"
    atoms and that process releases vasts amount of energy. This energy can be
    used to boil water.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We can use the sun (solar energy). Using mirrors and lenses, we can
    reflect the sun's light to a small location that generates huge amount of
    heat that can be used to boil water.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>It's a long and somewhat complicated process, but that is how electrical
  energy is typically generated. But, how does it go from being created by the
  power companies in their buildings to powering the electronics in your home?
  Power lines (also called transmission lines) are long thick metal cables that
  connect the power source to your home.
  The power company relies on a vast network 
  (often
  called "the grid") 
  of interconnected transmission lines 
  that delivers electrical energy from the places where it
  is being created all the way to you and your neighbor's homes.</p>

</div>
  <p>Its important to note in the above picture that the generator, wires, and
  lightbulb form one continuous loop. It's a big loop &mdash; but like we mentioned
  earlier, all working electric circuits must form a closed loop. It is no
  different when that electrical energy is coming from the power company.</p>

  <p>Think about this as you work on the following project, where we will stop
  using the battery to power our circuit and will instead use power coming from
  the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi gets <i>it's</i> power from the wall
  outlet, which is connected to a generator at a power plant far away in one
  long continuous loop. So, while you may be thinking that you have created a
  small closed loop circuit on your breadboard, in reality, you have created a
  closed loop that's miles long all the way back to the power plant.</p>
