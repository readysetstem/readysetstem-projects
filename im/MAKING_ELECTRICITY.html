  <h1>How Electricity is Made</h1>
  <img src="img/hoover-dam-generators-small.jpg"
  style="max-width: 400px;" alt="">
  <p style="text-align: center"><i>Electric Generators at the Hoover Dam</i></p>
  <p>In our previous projects, we used a battery to power our circuits.
  Batteries play a critical part in powering our everyday devices, from mobile
  phones and laptops, to watches and hearing aids. Batteries are a common
  source of power for many electronic devices, but it's certainly not the only
  option for electrical power.</p>

  <p>Most of the electrical energy we use in our everyday lives comes from the
  power company. This electrical energy is readily available to us through
  electrical outlets around our homes — it heats our houses, runs our
  computers, cooks our food, lights our rooms, recharges our batteries, and so
  much more... But, where does the energy to do this come from, and how does it
  get to our homes?</p>

  <p>There are a number of different ways that the power company provides
  electric power, but the most common way is through an electric generator. A
  generator is a device that converts mechanical energy (movement) into
  electrical energy. When everything is set up properly, all you need to do to
  generate electrical energy is to provide the mechanical energy to turn the
  generator. For example, if you actually turn a generator by hand, then
  <i>you</i> can generate electrical energy.</p>

  <p>One thing to remember, though — electrical energy is never "made" out of
  thin air. The energy already exists — we simply convert other forms of energy
  (like the energy you use to turn the generator) into electrical energy.</p>

  <p>But how does an electric generator "convert" mechanical energy into
  electrical energy?  That's where magnets come into play...</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Funky magnets. How do they work?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>It turns out that magnetism and electricity and are two very
    related concepts — either one can be used to create the other. If you put a
    magnet near a conductor and move it around, it will generate an electric
    current; likewise, an electric current moving through a conductor
    creates a magnetic pulling force.</p>

    <p>This is the principle used by the power companies in their electric
    generators. By repeatedly moving a magnet within a closed loop of
    conducting wire (or moving the wire around the magnet), a current is
    generated in the loop.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that the reverse is true as well: an electric current
    flowing through a conductor that's near a magnet will pull the magnet
    (since the electric current creates a magnetic pulling force). This is how
    an electric <i>motor</i> works — a current in a loop of wire causes a
    magnet to turn. This is good to understand, as electric motors are used
    everywhere — they spin washing machines, they run air conditioners and
    refrigerators, they pump water, and they even turn the wheels on electric
    vehicles.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now that you know that power companies create electric current by rotating
  a magnet around a loop of wire (or a loop of wire around a magnet), you may
  be wondering how the magnet (or the wire) is rotated. 
  As you might imagine, power companies don't actually have people turning
  cranks on a generator all day to generate power. So, exactly how do they do
  it? </p>
  
  <p>Turning an electric generator is generally
  accomplished by pushing steam through a turbine (which is basically a large
  fan with many fan blades) — the steam pushes the blades of the turbine, which
  turns the shaft of the generator, which moves the magnet (or wire) to
  generate electrical energy.</p>

  <p>Which leads us to our next question — how do you generate steam? To
  generate steam, we need to boil water. This can be done in one of many
  ways:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>We can burn something to heat the water. In the United States, this is
    the primary way of generating electrical energy and typically the thing that
    we burn is coal (and sometimes natural gas). This is why you will often
    hear that coal is used to generate electricity.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We can use nuclear energy. Nuclear reactors use a process of "splitting"
    atoms and that process releases vasts amount of energy. This energy can be
    used to boil water.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We can use the sun (solar energy). Using mirrors and lenses, we can
    reflect the sun's light to a small location which generates a huge amount of
    heat that can be used to boil water.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

<p>Boiling water to turn a turbine isn't the only way to turn a generator and
generate electrical energy.  In fact, sometimes you can turn generator
directly.  For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>A hydroelectric power plant user the power of a water fall to turn
    the shaft of a generator.
    </li>
    <li><p>A wind turbine uses the force of the wind to directly turn the shaft
    of a generator.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>And, there are other ways to generate electrical energy as well, including solar
cells, which directly convert the sun's energy to electric current, without any
moving parts at all!</p>

 <h1>Electricity Transmission</h1>
  <p>It's a long and somewhat complicated process, but that is how electrical
  energy is typically generated. But, how does it go from being created by the
  power companies in their buildings to powering the electronics in your home?
  Power lines (also called transmission lines) are long thick metal cables that
  connect the power source to your home. The power company relies on a vast
  network (often called "the grid") of interconnected transmission lines that
  delivers electrical energy from the places where it is being created all the
  way to you and your neighbors' homes.</p>

   Transmission Lines</p>

  </div>
  </div>

  <p>Its important to note in the above picture that the generator, wires, and
  lightbulb form one continuous loop. It's a big loop — but like we mentioned
  earlier, all working electric circuits must form a closed loop. It is no
  different when that electrical energy is coming from the power company.</p>

  <p>Think about this as you work on the following project, where we will stop
  using the battery to power our circuit and will instead use power coming from
  the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi gets <i>it's</i> power from the wall
  outlet, which is connected to a generator at a power plant far away in one
  long continuous loop. So, while you may be thinking that you have created a
  small closed loop circuit on your breadboard, in reality, you have created a
  closed loop that's miles long all the way back to the power plant.</p>
