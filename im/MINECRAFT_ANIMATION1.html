  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>In this project, we'll use the LED Matrix to display an animation (a
  "sprite") of Steve, our Minecraft character. While there is no Minecraft
  integration in this project, it will provide the basis for our next project,
  where we integrate LED Matrix animation with action in the Minecraft
  world.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">&lt; <img class="bb" src=

 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>We talked about sprites very briefly back in our Space Invaders project,
  and in this project and the next, we're going to build on this. Sprites are
  essentially pixel-by-pixel graphics that can be moved or changed. Using the
  LED Matrix and the RaspberrySTEM API, it's easy to create and animate spites
  on the LED Matrix.</p>

  <p>Sprites can be built to run on the LED Matrix display using a list of 8x8
  pixelated designs. Each design consists of 0's -- which indicate that an LED
  is off -- and non-0's -- which indicate that an LED is on and the brightness
  of the LED. The non-0's range from 1-8 and A-F -- the higher the value
  (letters are higher than numbers), the brighter the LED will appear.</p>

  <p>As an example, we could define a single sprite design as the
  following:</p>

  <p><code>00000000<br>
  00000000<br>
  00000000<br>
  00000000<br>
  00000000<br>
  00000000<br>
  00000000<br>
  00000000<br>
  00000000<br></code></p>

  <p>If we were to display that design on the LED Matrix using our sprite API,
  all the LEDs on the matrix would be turned off. Likewise, if we were to
  define our sprit design as follows:</p>

  <p><code>FFFFFFFF<br>
  FFFFFFFF<br>
  FFFFFFFF<br>
  FFFFFFFF<br>
  FFFFFFFF<br>
  FFFFFFFF<br>
  FFFFFFFF<br>
  FFFFFFFF<br></code></p>

  <p>all LEDs on the matrix would be turned on at full intensity. As another
  example, if we wanted to display a smiley face on our LED Matrix, we could
  use the following design:</p>

  <p><code>00F00F00<br>
  00F00F00<br>
  00F00F00<br>
  00000000<br>
  F000000F<br>
  0F0000F0<br>
  00FFFF00<br>
  00000000<br></code></p>

  <p>This would result in the following being displayed on the LED Matrix:</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 300px" alt="" src=
  "img/led_smiley.jpg"></div>

    <code>cycle()</code> Function
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>You'll notice that we use a new function in our code above --
    <code>cycle()</code>. This function takes any type of list (list,
    dictionary, set, etc) and creates an infinitely repeating series of values
    using the items in the list.</p>

    <p>Using the <code>next()</code> function, we can iterate through the cycle
    we've created. When we reach the end of the list in the cycle, it will
    simply repeat; this will continue for as long as we continue to request the
    next item in the list.</p>

    <p>For this project, we're creating a sprite that has four separate
    designs. We use <code>cycle()</code> and <code>next()</code> to cycle
    through these four designs, which makes it appear that our character is
    running on the LED Matrix.</p>
