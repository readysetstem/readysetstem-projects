  <p>In this project, we integrate the multiple buttons we implemented several
  projects ago along with the note/sound generation from the sound functions
  and the speaker.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>Using the hardware setup from <a data-uid="manybuttons"></a>, we can turn
  our CREATOR Kit into a very basic piano. We will start with four buttons each
  wired to a GPIO as input, and write some code that will generate
  corresponding note when each button is pressed. We'll keep it simple in this
  project, and just play each note for one second.</p>

  <p>Your breadboard will use the same circuit we wired in the <a data-uid=
  "manybuttons"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it should look like:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Many_Buttons_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>The code for this project is straightforward:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>First, we import the functions we'll be using.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Next, we initialize the buttons with their corresponding GPIOs and
    initialize the notes with our sound functions.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Then, we create a while loop that will continually test each button for
    a press, and if a press if received, will play the corresponding note.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is what the code should look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.sound import Note
import time

buttons_and_notes = [
    [Button(14), Note('C')],
    [Button(15), Note('D')],
    [Button(25), Note('E')],
    [Button(7), Note('G')],
    ]

while True:
    for button, note in buttons_and_notes:
        if button.is_pressed():
            note.play()
    time.sleep(0.01)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Try this, and you'll likely notice that the there's a popping/crackling
  sound while you hold the button down. The reason is that when the button is
  pressed, the program will try to <i>replay</i> the note over and over again,
  each time through the <code>while</code> loop. When you <i>replay</i> a note
  (that is, play a note that is already playing), you'll hear a little pause as
  the note stops and restarts. That is the clicking you hear &mdash; and we'll fix
  this in the next project.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Can you modify the code remove the popping/cracking sound? (Don't cheat
    &mdash; we'll get to an answer in the next project).</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you modify only your <i>hardware</i> so that a 'C' note plays only
    if <i>all</i> of the buttons are pressed? Hint: think about buttons in
    series or parallel.</p>
   </li>

    <p>We picked the notes (C, D, E and G) so that we could play the song that
    we created in <a data-uid="mary"></a>. Give it a try!</p>
