  <p>In this project, we're going to write our first piece of code.</p>

  <p>It's customary in the programming world that the very first program you
  write is called, "Hello, World!" The purpose of this program is simple — have
  the computer print the words, "Hello, World!" on the screen.</p>

  <p>Since we're not ones to buck tradition, we're going to make "Hello,
  World!" our very first project as well. The nice thing about this project is
  that it's easy to do (it's only one line of code) and it will give us an
  opportunity to start exploring our Ready Set STEM Development Environment
  (RDE).</p>

    What is Programming?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to
    follow. You write these instructions using an editing tool (we provide a
    custom editing tool as part of the Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit) and then
    "send" those instructions to the the computer to carry out (or "execute").
    Just like there are lots of different languages that people can speak,
    there are also many languages that computer instructions can be written in
    — each of which will ultimately be converted into a format that the
    computer understands.</p>

    <p>The CREATOR Kit supports many different programming languages, but we
    will primarily be focused on one of the most common, called Python. Python
    is a versatile language that is used in both the academic and the
    professional worlds to build a varied set of applications and tools.
    Learning how to program in the Python programming language will provide a
    solid foundation for all future programming education.</p>

 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p><i>Software</i> is a fancy name for computer code. Typically, we refer to
  a very big computer program (like an entire game or application) as software,
  but in reality, even just a single line of code is also considered software.</p>

  <p>It's now time to enter the code for this project. In the Code Window,
  enter the following:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
print("Hello, World!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>A few things worth noting at this point:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>The line number "1" will automatically be visible before you start
    entering your code (you don't need to enter line numbers). In future
    projects, we'll only include line numbers in the code boxes when it makes
    it easier to discuss specific lines of code.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Capitalization generally <i>does</i> matter when you're programming. In
    this line of code, if the word "print" isn't in all lowercase letters, you
    may find that your code doesn't work as expected.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>It's possible to copy-and-paste code into the Code Window instead of
    typing it all in. As an example of how you do this, you can copy-and-paste
    the line above right into your code window. To do that, follow these
    steps:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>

      <p>Highlight the <code>print('Hello, World!')</code> line in the code box
      above using your mouse</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>Press and hold the &lt;CTRL&gt; key on your keyboard and press the
      letter "C" at the same time — this creates a copy of your text</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>Click in the Code Window where you want to paste the code</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>Press and hold the &lt;CTRL&gt; key on your keyboard and press the
      letter "V" at the same time — this pastes the text</p>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="step">Run Your Code</h3>

  <p>Now that you've typed (or copied-and-pasted) the line of code into the Code
  Window, let's see if it works. We do this by <i>running</i> the program. To
  run the program, click on the Play icon (<img class="inline_icon" alt="" src=
  "img/play.png">) at the top of the Code Window.</p>

  <p>The program runs by starting at the first line, doing what that line says
  (<i>executing</i> that line), and then moving on to the next line. It does
  that until it reaches the bottom. In this case, we only have one line, so
  only that line of code is executed.</p>

  <p>It may take a few seconds for the code to run, and you may notice two
  things during this time:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>The triangular PLAY icon turns to a square; and</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The little Ready Set STEM icon at the top of the code window
    spins.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>These are just indications that the Raspberry Pi is busy running your
  code. And don't worry if you don't notice these things — sometimes they
  happen so fast they they're not very noticeable.</p>
  <h3 class="step">Verify the "Output" of Your Code</h3>

  <p>If you've done everything correctly, you should see the following in your
  Program Output window (the window in the lower left of the RDE, below the
  Code Window):</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
Hello, World!
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">-- PROGRAM FINISHED --</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The first line of the output window is the result of the code you've
  written — you've successfully had the computer print the words "Hello,
  World!"</p>

  <p>The last line indicates that the program is finished running &mdash; this will
  be helpful later when you're writing longer and more complicated
  programs.</p>

  <p><strong>Congratulations! You've just written your first
  program!</strong></p>

  <p>But wait! What if the output from your program doesn't look like it's
  supposed to? Or if you get a jumbled red and black error-looking message in
  the Program Output window? If that's the case, you likely have an error in
  your code.</p>

  <p>But, even if your code worked perfectly and you didn't get any errors in
  your code above, we highly recommend reading <a data-uid="errors"></a>, as
  you're certain to encounter programming errors at some point.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>We picked <code>"Hello, World!"</code> as the text to print — why not
    try printing something else?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Try writing a program to print multiple lines of text. For example, a
    joke:</p>
    <div class="output">
     <pre>
Q: How many programmers does it take 
   to change a light bulb?
A: None, that's a hardware problem.
</pre>
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Try writing some code that <i>doesn't</i> work &mdash; that is, a program
	that generates an error message. Examine the error message to see where your code 
	failed.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </div>
