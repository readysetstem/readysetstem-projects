 <div class="section" id="intro">

  <p>In this project, for the first time, we'll use GPIOs to control some
  hardware. Specifically, we'll wire an LED and then control the LED output
  using code that we'll write.</p>

  <p>Before jumping into this project, we very strongly recommend that you read
  <a data-uid="gpioc"></a>, as the concepts discussed there will be the basis
  for this project and nearly all future Ready Set STEM projects.</p>

  <p>In a previous project, we created a circuit that allowed us to control an
  LED using a pushbutton — the LED was controlled solely using other hardware.
  But, the most fun and exciting part of the CREATOR Kit is
  using software to control the hardware to make it do interesting and useful
  things.</p>

  <p>In this project, we'll rebuild a version of our original circuit (with
  just the power source, LED and resistor), but we'll the wire up the LED a
  little differently and then write some code to control it using the Raspberry
  Pi's GPIOs.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>Before we start the new wiring for this project, let's wire up our
  original circuit from the <a data-uid="rpipower"></a> project — this will
  give us some context so we can understand how we're going from that circuit
  (which uses strictly hardware to control the LED) to our new circuit (which
  uses a GPIO to control the LED). As a reminder, here is what that circuit
  looks like and how you'll want to wire your breadboard:</p>
  
  <img class="bb" src="img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_Power_bb.jpg" alt="">

  <p>The LED should now be lit.</p>

  <p>Now that we have some background on how GPIOs work and how we can control
  our LED with a GPIO, and now that we've wired up a circuit that we're
  familiar with, let's jump in and start using GPIOs...</p>
  <h2 class="step">Disconnect the circuit from ground.</h2>

  <p>The LED is currently connected to ground via the green wire. To disconnect
  it, remove the green wire: <img class="bb" src=
  "img/Introducing_Buttons_1_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>The circuit is no longer a closed loop and the LED should no longer be
  lit.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Connect the circuit to a GPIO.</h2>

  <p>Now, connect a wire from the LED to a GPIO as shown in the diagram.</p>

  <p>For this project, we will assume that you're using GPIO14 on the Lid
  Connector Board, though you're welcome to use any GPIO — just remember that
  you'll need to modify the code appropriately if you choose a GPIO other
  than 14 for this project.</p>

  <p>This is what your breadboard should now look like:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_GPIO_bb.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Inner Workings of GPIOs
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>You will probably notice that the LED is not lit at this point, even
    though we've hooked it up to the GPIO. The reason for this is that the
    GPIO, by default, outputs a "high" voltage (3.3 volts). As we discussed in
    the previous concept, if the GPIO voltage is high, there is no voltage
    difference across the LED, and as a result no electric current will flow —
    the LED will not light up.</p>

    <p>The code we're about to write will set the GPIO voltage low (also known
    as ground, or 0V). When the GPIO is low, current can flow through the LED,
    because there is now a voltage difference across the LED.</p>

    <p>These concepts can be a bit confusing at first, but as you use GPIOs
    more and more, the concepts and the conventions should become clearer.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now that our circuit is complete, let's write the software.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">
  <h2 class="step">Write the code.</h2>

  <p>The code to control the GPIO (and with it, the LED) is pretty short. It
  uses a function called <code>Output()</code> to configure a GPIO as an
  output.</p>

  <p>Type (or copy-and-paste) the following code into your RDE's Code
  Window:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Output
my_led = Output(14)
my_led.on()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>At this point, we don't expect you'll fully understand the code above.
  However, there are a couple important ideas to notice in the code:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 2, we're configuring GPIO14 as an output. Every time we use a
    GPIO, we need to configure it as either an input or an output — it can't be
    both at once.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 3, we're turning the LED on.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other aspects of the code that you might not understand will become more
  clear as we progress through the tutorials. For now, understanding the basic
  concepts above should be enough to get you started.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Run the code.</h2>

  <p>Run the code the same way you did in the <a data-uid="hello"></a> project
  – press the Play icon above the code window. Assuming you did everything
  correctly, the LED should now be lit.</p>

  <p>Congratulations! You just controlled some hardware you built using
  software you wrote.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>The circuit shown uses GPIO14 to control the LED. Can you modify the
    circuit and the code to use a different GPIO?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The <code>my_led.on()</code> command turns the LED on by modifying the
    GPIO voltage. Can you guess how to change this command to turn the LED
    <i>off</i>?</p>
   </li>
