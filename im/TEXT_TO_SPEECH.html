  <h1>How Robots Talk</h1>

  <p>On TV, the movies, and even the real world, you'll often hear robots
  speak in a metallic, not-very-fluid voice &mdash; we often even refer to
  it as a "robot voice."  The reason robots and machines tend to sound this
  way is that, while <i>recorded</i> voices can provide a very accurate 
  reproduction of the original sound, computer generated sound isn't as
  accurate.  
  
  <p>In order for machines to use real recorded sounds, you need to know the exact 
  speech that the machine might want to say, which is impossible if you want to have a 
  computer or robot respond with arbitrary sentences. Since you can't know 
  what might need to be said beforehand, and because you can't record
  <i>everything</i>, it's often better to let the computer generate its own
  sounds, even if they don't sound completely human.</p>

  <p>For years, programmers have been working on making computers be able to
  say arbitrary sentence while sounding the same as a human. This process is
  called "text-to-speech" (or TTS). And even though we have come a long way, most people
  can still detect the robotic voices that you often hear coming from your
  computer, phone or car.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="section">
  <h1>Using TTS</h1>

  <p>As we saw earlier, the Ready Set STEM API provides some simple functions 
  to play recorded sounds that are on the SD card. But, the API also provides
  a function to take a text string and convert it to sound:</p>

  <pre>
Speech(<i>text_to_speak</i>)
</pre>

  <p>where <code><i>text_to_speak</i></code> is a string of text that you
  want the computer to speak.</p>

  <p>For example, you can try this:</p>

  <div class="code" data-firstline="1"> 
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
madbro = Speech('Y U MAD BRO?')
madbro.play()
madbro.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>


 <div class="section">
  <h1>Sound Chains</h1>

  <p>Oftentimes, you may want to perform a common sequence of operations in a row. 
  For example, we've been doing this with sounds, where we first create the sound 
  (or note or speech), then we play it, then we wait for it to finish. We've 
  been doing this using three lines of code, as you can see in our example above.</p>

  <p>But, when we have sequences of commands that are commonly run in order, many 
  times the API will provide a simpler way to do it, called <i>chaining</i>. The 
  Ready Set STEM API supports chaining for sounds, making it much easier and more
  concise.  
  
  <p>As an example, we can take our four-line piece of code from above:

  <div class="code" data-firstline="1"> 
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
madbro = Speech('Y U MAD BRO?')
madbro.play()
madbro.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>
  
  <p>And we can simplify it to the following two lines:
  </p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
Speech('Y U MAD BRO?').play().wait()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The above creates some speech, plays it, and waits for it exactly as
  before, but does it in a much more efficient way.</p>
