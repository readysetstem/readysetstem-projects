  <h1>How Robots Talk</h1>

  <p>On TV, the movies, and even the real world, you'll often hear robots speak
  in a metallic, not-very-fluid voice — we often even refer to it as a "robot
  voice." The reason robots and machines tend to sound this way is that, while
  <i>recorded</i> voices can provide a very accurate reproduction of the
  original sound, computer generated sound isn't as accurate.</p>

  <p>In order for machines to use real recorded sounds, you need to know the
  exact speech that the machine might want to say, which is impossible if you
  want to have a computer or robot respond with arbitrary sentences. Since you
  can't know what might need to be said beforehand, and because you can't
  record <i>everything</i>, it's often better to let the computer generate its
  own sounds, even if they don't sound completely human.</p>

  <p>For years, programmers have been working on making computers be able to
  say arbitrary sentence while sounding the same as a human. This process is
  called "text-to-speech" (or TTS). And even though we have come a long way,
  most people can still detect the robotic voices that you often hear coming
  from your computer, phone or car.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Using TTS</h1>

  <p>As we saw earlier, the Ready Set STEM API provides some simple functions
  to play recorded sounds that are on the SD card. But, the API also provides a
  function to take a text string and convert it to sound:</p>
  <pre>
Speech(<i>text_to_speak</i>)
</pre>

  <p>where <code><i>text_to_speak</i></code> is a string of text that you want
  the computer to speak.</p>

  <p>For example, you can try this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
madbro = Speech('Y U MAD BRO?')
madbro.play()
madbro.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Volume Control
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>The base CREATOR Kit speaker is unamplified, and has a volume similar to
    that of a speaker in a greeting card. As such, the volume, which is by
    default at its maximum, can still sometimes be hard to hear.</p>

    <p>To make <i>really</i> loud sounds, you can use external speakers or
    headphones. However, even with the unamplified speaker, you can "overdrive"
    the speaker by setting the volume to louder than the maximum. The drawback
    is that the sound will be distorted — and the more you increase the volume
    past the maximum, the more distorted it will be.</p>

    <p>All <code>Sound</code>s, <code>Note</code>s, and <code>Speech</code> can
    have their volume changed by running:</p>
    <pre>
my_sound.volume = <i>new_volume</i>
</pre>

    <p>where <code>new_volume</code> is an integer that is the volume
    percentage. By default, the volume is set at 100 (that is 100%, which is
    the maximum).</p>

    <p>So, for example, to say "hello" at louder than max, you might do:</p>
    <pre>
from rstem.sound import Speech
hello = Speech('Hello.')
hello.volume = 400
hello.play()
hello.wait()
</pre>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Sound Chains</h1>

  <p>Oftentimes, you may want to perform a common sequence of operations in a
  row. For example, we've been doing this with sounds, where we first create
  the sound (or note or speech), then we play it, then we wait for it to
  finish. We've been doing this using three lines of code, as you can see in
  our example above.</p>

  <p>But, when we have sequences of commands that are commonly run in order,
  many times the API will provide a simpler way to do it, called
  <i>chaining</i>. The Ready Set STEM API supports chaining for sounds, making
  it much easier and more concise.</p>

  <p>As an example, we can take our four-line piece of code from above:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
madbro = Speech('Y U MAD BRO?')
madbro.play()
madbro.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>And we can simplify it to the following two lines:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
Speech('Y U MAD BRO?').play().wait()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The above creates some speech, plays it, and waits for it exactly as
  before, but does it in a much more efficient way.</p>
