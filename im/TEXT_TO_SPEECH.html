  <h1>How robots talk</h1>

  <p>On TV, the movies, and even the real world, you'll often hear a robot
  speak in a metallic, not-very-fluid voice. The reason, is that although
  <i>recorded</i> voices can provide a very accurate reproduction of the
  original sound, in order to use them, you need to know the exact speech to
  record. If you want to have a computer or robot respond with arbitrary
  sentences, you can't know what to record before hand. And you can't record
  <i>everything</i>.</p>

  <p>For years, programmers have been working on making computers be able to
  say arbitrary sentence while sounding the same as a human. This process is
  called "text-to-speech". And even though we have come a long way, most people
  can still detect the robotic voices that you often hear coming from your
  computer, phone or car.</p>

  <h1>Using TTS</h1>

  <p>The Ready Set STEM API provides some simple functions to play
  recorded sounds that are on the SD card. The main function you'll used to
  play sounds is:</p>
  <pre>
Sound(<i>text_to_speak</i>)
</pre>

  <p>where <code><i>text_to_speak</i></code> is a string of text that you
  want to speak.</p>

  <p>For example, to hear a cat meow, try this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
madbro = Speech('Y U MAD BRO?')
madbro.play()
madbro.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>

  <h1>Sound chains</h1>

  <p>Often in programming languages, you may want to perform a sequence
  of operations in a row. We've been doing this with sounds, where we first
  create the sound (or note or speech), then we play it, then we wait for it to
  finish.</p>

  <p>Because this is so common, many times APIs will provide a simpler
  way to do this, called chaining. The Ready Set STEM API supports this for
  sounds, and it makes playing a sound or speech very concise. The code above
  as a simplified call chain would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Speech
Speech('Y U MAD BRO?').play().wait()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The above creates some speech, plays it, and waits for it exactly as
  before.</p>
