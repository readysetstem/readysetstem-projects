 <div class="hw" data-count="1" data-name="button"></div>
 <div class="section" id="intro">

  <p>In this project, we will use a GPIO to read the state (pressed or
  unpressed) of a button.</p>

  <p>In <a data-uid="gpioi"></a>, we introduced the idea of reading button
  state based on using GPIOs as inputs. We also provided the schematic for the
  circuit we'd need to accomplish this. It turns out that implementing that
  circuit on our breadboard is easy. Let's give it a try...</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">
  <h2 class="step">Reading Buttons Using GPIOs.</h2>

  <p>First, we start with an empty breadboard, with power and ground wired from
  the Lid Connector Board, like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Just_Power_bb.jpg" alt="">

  <p>With our breadboard empty, here is how we build our circuit and then use
  code to get input from the button through the GPIO:</p>
  <h2 class="step">Place button on breadboard.</h2>

  <p>We start by placing a button on the breadboard. Remember, it is important
  that the button is oriented correctly — the two independent sides of the
  button must sit on different connect strips, as follows:</p>
  <table class="basic">
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_correct.png" width="285" alt=""></td>
     <td><img src="img/Button_orientation_wrong.png" width="285" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td><strong>CORRECT</strong></td>
     <td><strong><span style="color: red;">WRONG!!!</span></strong></td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Also note, the button can be placed fully within a single row of connect
  strips (as shown above), or it can be placed across the notch in the
  breadboard, as we'll do in the next step. The choice only depends on where
  you'd like to place the button.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Wire one side of the button to a GPIO.</h2>

  <p>Next, we connect one side of the button (it doesn't matter which one, as
  the internal components of the button are symmetrical) to a GPIO. In this
  example, we'll connect the button to GPIO14.</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Buttons_with_GPIO_1_bb.jpg" alt="">
  <h2 class="step">Wire the other side of the button to ground.</h2>

  <p>Finally, we connect the other side of the button to ground.</p><img class=
  "bb" src="img/Buttons_with_GPIO_2_bb.jpg" alt="">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The 3.3V power isn't being used for this circuit,
  but it's always good to have power wired to the breadboard...and, we'll need
  it later when we expand on this button circuit.</p>

  <p>That's it for the wiring – pretty simple, right?</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>Now that the circuit is wired, we can write the code to get the GPIO state
  (low or high):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
my_button = Button(14)
print(my_button.is_pressed())
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In this most basic example, we are reading the GPIO a single time (the
  moment the program is run) and we are printing the state of the button at
  that moment. Try running the program a couple times, either holding down or
  not holding down the button at the moment the program is run.</p>

  <p>You may notice that this example is similar to the <a data-uid=
  "gpoutp"></a> example, but in this case, we configure the GPIO as a button
  instead of an output:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 2, we're configuring GPIO14 as a button input.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 3, we're getting the state of the button and printing it.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>We'll look at these concepts again in more detail in upcoming
  projects.</p>

  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Why <code>Button</code>?
   </div>
   <div>

  <p>In <a data-uid="gpioi"></a>, we discussed reading buttons using GPIO inputs.  But now, in
  this project, we're using <code>Button</code> to create our button variable instead of
  <code>Input</code>.  Why the change?

  <p><code>Button</code> is just a special case of <code>Input</code> that provides
  extra features for buttons.  For example, instead of testing if the button input
  <code>is_on</code> as we did in the  
  <a data-uid="gpioi"></a> project, we instead tested if the button input
  <code>is_pressed</code>.

  <p>For now, just know that we're using <code>Button</code> because we are
  physically connecting up a button.  In later projects, we'll discuss some of
  the special features that
  <code>Button</code>s can use.</p>

   </div>
  </div>
  <p>To make the program a little more interesting (and convenient!), we can
  insert a loop so that, instead of just reading the state of the GPIO one
  time, we can continually read and print the state of the GPIO for as long as
  the program is running.</p>

  <p>Here's what that code would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
import time

my_button = Button(14)

while True: 
    print(my_button.is_pressed())
    time.sleep(0.1)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Run this program and then alternate between pressing and not pressing the
  button. Take a look at the output window &mdash; you should see an indication of
  when the button is pressed and when it is released.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    while True:
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>You may have noticed that we used a new programming concept above:</p>
    <pre>
while True:
</pre>

    <p>We'll discuss exactly how this works in a future project, but for now,
    just know that using this line of code will force the block of code below
    it to be repeated over and over, forever.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>When you're done testing your button, you can stop the program by pressing
  the square STOP icon in the upper-left-hand corner of the code window (this
  icon replaced the PLAY icon while the program was running).</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>We placed the button on the breadboard so that it sat across the notch.
    Try hooking it up within a single row of connect strips (as we showed how
    to do in the orientation diagram above in Step #2).</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Try hooking up two buttons to two different GPIOs, and modify the code to print when either
    one is pressed.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>With two buttons hooked up, print something only when BOTH of them are
    pressed at the same time.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
