  <h1>FOR Loops</h1>

  <p>In <a data-uid="while"></a>, we discussed how <code>while</code> loops can
  be used to cycle through code an indefinite (or even an infinite) number of
  times. But, what about when you only want to cycle through a piece of code a
  specific number of times? For that, we can use another type of loop called a
  <code>for</code> loop.</p>

  <p><code>for</code> loops allow you to cycle through a sequence of items: a
  range of numbers, a list of items, a string and more. As an example, a
  <code>for</code> loop can be used to simply iterate through a list of
  numbers and execute a statement (or set of statements) on each
  iteration:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("This is time #", x, "through the loop.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you ran that code, the output would be:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
This is time # 1 through the loop.
This is time # 2 through the loop.
This is time # 3 through the loop.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Essentially, the code ran through the code block 3 times, and with each
  time through the loop, the loop variable <code>x</code> was set to the next
  item in the list.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Range</h1>

  <p>Because counting through a list of numbers is very common, Python provides
  a built-in function to help us do specifically that: <code>range()</code>.
  Range returns a sequence of numbers, from 0 up to the just before the number
  we give it.</p>

  <p>Here's an example:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
for x in range(5):
    print("This is time #", x, "through the loop.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you ran that code, the output would be:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
This is time # 0 through the loop.
This is time # 1 through the loop.
This is time # 2 through the loop.
This is time # 3 through the loop.
This is time # 4 through the loop.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This time, you'll notice that the list starts counting at 0 not 1, as
  that's how <code>range()</code> works. You may remember from the <a data-uid=
  "lists"></a> concept that list items are counted starting from 0 as well.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Looping Through Lists</h1>

  <p>We can also use <code>for</code> loops to iterate through the items in a
  list. Here's the example from the <a data-uid="lists"></a> concept â€” a list
  of the first five months of the year:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We can use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through each item in that
  list and do what we want with it. As a simple example, we can print each item
  and also the number of letters it has:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]

for month in months:
    print(month, len(month))
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here's the output from that code:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
January 7
February 8
March 5
April 5
May 3
</pre>
  </div>
 </div>
</body>
