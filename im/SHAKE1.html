  <p>In this project, we start creating an accelerometer game that commands the
  user to shake and tilt the CREATOR Kit in a random order.  The challenge is
  to correctly shake/tilt the kit even as the game gets progressively faster.

  <p>We'll start simple. There will only be one action the user can take: tilt
  the kit left.  But, in our program, we'll still need to calculate if the user
  tilted it left within a shortr amount of time.

 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>You'll need to wire up the Accelerometer as done in previous projects.
  Here is what your breadboard should look like once the accelerometer is
  properly wired:</p>

 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>For our first cut, we'll always request that the user tilts left.  Then, we'll simply print
  out if the user correctly tilted left, or didn't.

            tilt_left_score += 1

        if tilt_left_score > SCORE_NEEDED:

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
   <li> <p>
In Lines 6 though 14, we intialize some variables we'll need later.  The variables
<code>NOACTION</code>, 
<code>LEFT</code>,
<code>RIGHT</code>,
<code>UP</code>, and
<code>SHAKE</code> are used to keep track of which action is requested.  
And, for now, this game will only use
<code>NOACTION</code> and
<code>LEFT</code>.

   </p></li> <li> <p>
   In Lines 16 through 18, at the start of the game loop, we define two variables:
   <code>request</code> and <code>action</code>.
   The <code>request</code> is what we want the user to do, and the <code>action</code> is what
   the user has actually done.  
   For this first cut at the game, we will only request that they
   tilt left.  And, we assume at first that they have taken <code>NOACTION</code>
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   In Lines 20 through 30, we record what action the user has taken.  To determine the action
   they've taken, we test the forces on the accelerometer.  We'll keep score of every time they
   are tilting the accelerometer to the left, and increase the score.  Once they've gotten over
   some threshold (SCORE_NEEDED), then we know they've taken that action.  The reason we need to
   keep score (instead of just assuming that the user is tilting the kit the first time we read
   the accelerometer) is that sometimes a jiggle of the kit will read as a tilt.  We want to make
   sure that the user <i>really</i> meant to tilt the kit by checking a number of times.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   In Lines 32 through 36, we check if the our <code>request</code> matches the user's
   <code>action</code>.  If not, the game is over and we exit the while loop.
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li> <p>
   The <code>SCORE_NEEDED</code> value affects how sensitive our code is at detecting tilts, and
   also affects how long it takes to detect the tilt.  Try changing 
   <code>SCORE_NEEDED</code> to a high or low value, and see how it affects the tilt detection.
