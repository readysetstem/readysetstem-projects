  <p>In this project, we begin creating an accelerometer game that commands the
  user to shake and tilt the CREATOR Kit in a random order. The challenge is to
  correctly shake/tilt the kit even as the game gets progressively faster.</p>

  <p>For this project, we'll start simple...  There will only be one action the 
  user can take: tilt the kit left. In subsquent projects we'll add more 
  functionality to complete the game.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>This project will only require the accelerometer.  Here is what your breadboard 
  should look like once the accelerometer is properly wired:

  "">
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>For this first implementation of the game, we'll always request that the user 
  tilts the kit left. Then, we'll print out if the user correctly tilted left, or 
  made a mistake (didn't tilt left).</p>

  <p>Here's what the code will look like:
  
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
import time

accel = Accel()

NOACTION = 0
LEFT = 1
RIGHT = 2
UP = 3
SHAKE = 4

# Ready to play?
SCORE_NEEDED = 10
period = 300
while True:
    request = LEFT
    action = NOACTION
    print(request)

    tilt_left_score = 0
    for i in range(period):
        x, y, z = accel.forces()
        if x &gt; 0.75:
            tilt_left_score += 1

        if tilt_left_score &gt; SCORE_NEEDED:
            action = LEFT
            break

        time.sleep(0.01)

    if request == action:
        print("CORRECT!")
    else:
        print("OOPS!")
        break

    time.sleep(0.5)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 6 though 14, we initialize some variables we'll need later. The
    variables <code>NOACTION</code>, <code>LEFT</code>, <code>RIGHT</code>,
    <code>UP</code>, and <code>SHAKE</code> are used to keep track of which
    action is requested. And, for now, this game will only use
    <code>NOACTION</code> and <code>LEFT</code>.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 16 through 18, at the start of the game loop, we define two
    variables: <code>request</code> and <code>action</code>. The
    <code>request</code> is what we want the user to do, and the
    <code>action</code> is what the user has actually done. For this first cut
    at the game, we will only request that they tilt left. And, we assume at
    first that they have taken <code>NOACTION</code></p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 20 through 30, we record what action the user has taken. To
    determine the action they've taken, we test the forces on the
    accelerometer. We'll keep score of every time they are tilting the
    accelerometer to the left, and increase the score. Once they've gotten over
    some threshold (SCORE_NEEDED), then we know they've taken that action. The
    reason we need to keep score (instead of just assuming that the user is
    tilting the kit the first time we read the accelerometer) is that sometimes
    a jiggle of the kit will read as a tilt. We want to make sure that the user
    <i>really</i> meant to tilt the kit by checking a number of times.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 32 through 36, we check if the our <code>request</code> matches
    the user's <code>action</code>. If not, the game is over and we exit the
    while loop.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Try running the program and play around with tilting the kit to the left
  to get an idea of how sensitive it is to picking up and registering tilts.
 </div>
 
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>The <code>SCORE_NEEDED</code> value affects how sensitive our code is at
    detecting tilts, and also affects how long it takes to detect the tilt. Try
    changing <code>SCORE_NEEDED</code> to a high or low value, and see how it
    affects the tilt detection.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
