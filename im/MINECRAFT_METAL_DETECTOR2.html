  <p>In this project, we will improve upon the previous <a data-uid="metal1"></a> 
  project, where we wrote code to place a piece of gold in a random location 
  around the Minecraft world.  In this project, we'll add sound to make a true 
  metal detector.  As you get closer to the gold, we'll beep the speaker at 
  a faster and faster rate, until your character is right on top of it, at which
  point we'll continuously play the beep.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>Other than ensuring that your speaker is connected, there is no specific 
  hardware setup for this project. You will need to be able to move throughout 
  the Minecraft world to use the code you'll be writing, and to do that, you 
  are welcome to either use a keyboard/mouse or to use the Minecraft controller 
  we built earlier with the CREATOR Kit.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">
  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like when we add the 
  audio to indicate the user's proximity to the gold.  The new code is highlighted
  with arrows, and we'll discuss that code in more detail below:</p>

  <p>The important highlighted changes are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 24 through 26, we compute the distance between the gold and
   Steve.  With vectors, this is easy, because vectors provide a function
   <code>length()</code> that is the length of the vector.  However, we only
   want to know the distance in the X and Z directions (along the ground), so
   we <i>zero out</i> the Y direction.
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 28 through 34, we beep the speaker, if it's time to do so.  We
    need to determine the <code>next_beep_time</code> based on the
    distance from the gold: if we're right on top of the gold, beep forever;
    otherwise, we calculate the time to wait using the <code>log()</code>
    function.  If you haven't seen it before, <code>log()</code> is a mathematical
    function that basically returns the magnitude of a number.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>On Line 38, if the beep was playing forever when we ended the game loop, 
	we need to stop it.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Give it a try, and have fun searching for the gold!
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li> <p>
   Assuming you still have your controller wired up, add this metal detector code to 
	the Minecraft controller code (<a data-uid="mccontr3"></a> project) so that you
	can play the metal detector game using the CREATOR Kit as a controller.
    </p> </li> <li> <p> We used the <code>log()</code> function to compute the time to the next
    beep.  Can you modify that calculation to be based on
    <code>distance_to_gold</code> instead (in other words, not use <code>log()</code> function)?
	How does this affect the game?
    </p> </li> <li> <p> 
    In the <a data-uid="metal1"></a> project we challenged you to add more than one hidden
  gold block to make the game easier.  With this version of the game, the gold
  is hidden and its location is hinted at only by beeping, so it can often seem
  harder when there is more than one gold block.  Can you add a second gold block and end the
  game if you find either? Note: You'll want to compute the distance to each
  gold block, and use the shorter distance to calculate the beep frequency.
