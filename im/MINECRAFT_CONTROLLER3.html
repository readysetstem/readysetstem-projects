  <p>In our last project, we improved our Minecraft controller code to make it
  simpler and more readable (and also more extensible). But, with the current
  code, our controller is awkward because it requires us to rotate it away from
  us (which is difficult to do) in order for our character to look down.</p>

  <p>In this project, we're going to improve that â€” we're going to modify the
  tilt functionality so that our character is looking down while the controller is
  in the default position (horizontal or "flat on a table") and then we
  only need to rotate the controller towards us (which is easy) to have him
  look upwards.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section"><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Minecraft_Accel_4way_2buttons_bb.jpg" alt=""></div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>For this project, the changes to the code will be in the
  <code>while</code> loop, specifically around the <code>control.look()</code>
  function, which defines where the character is looking.</p>

  <p>In the previous 
  <a data-uid="mccontr2"></a> project, we used the X and Y values of the accelerometer to control
  which direction we looked:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
    control.look(up=50*y, left=50*x)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>And that works...  But there are two things we can improve on:
  <ol>
  <li><p>
  <strong>Too hard to look down:</strong>  To look down, you have to point the controller
  down, and it can be difficult to twist your wrists enough to tilt it fully
  down.  We can adjust this.
  </p></li> <li><p>
  <strong>Controller is not sensitive enough:</strong>  Currently, when you tilt the controller a
  little, Steve moves a little and when you tilt a lot, Steve moves a lot.
  That works reasonably well, but the current
  code doesn't take that far enough.
  </p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point
  (with new changes highlighted with arrows):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control
import time

control.show()

keymap = {
    Button(18) : control.left,
    Button(14) : control.right,
    Button(15) : control.forward,
    Button(23) : control.backward,
    Button(24)  : control.smash,
    Button(12) : control.jump,
    }

accel = Accel()

while True:
    for button, action in keymap.items():
        action(release=(not button.is_pressed()))

    x, y, z = accel.forces()
*    y -= 0.3
*    control.look(up=150*y*abs(y), left=150*x*abs(x))
    
    time.sleep(0.01)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>The above highlighted changes are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 24, we decrease the Y value by a small amount (0.3).  Now, when we hold the kit
    at a more comfortable angle (with Y pointing a little bit up) Steve won't move at all.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 25, we modify the accelerometer input we receive.  Previously, we converted the 
	accelerometer force to a reasonable value using the equation <code>50*x</code> that could
	be inserted into the <code>look()</code> (and likewise for <code>y</code>).  That made a small
    value of <code>x</code> move Steve a little, and a large value move him a lot.  We can
    increase this effect by using x-squared &mdash; a small value will still move him a little, and
    a large value will move him even more.   To use x-squared, you would expect the the code
    to be <code>x*x</code>, but instead we use <code>x*abs(x)</code>.  The reason is that 
    <code>x*x</code> changes negative numbers to positive, which we don't want.  Our code that uses
    <code>abs()</code> keeps negative <code>x</code> values negative.
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Also on Line 25, we've adjusted the multiplier from 50 to 150.  There is nothing scientific
	about this change &mdash; this just seemed to work better based on our experimentation!</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Go ahead and give your modified controller a try...
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>
    We increased the sensitivity of the controller by using x-squared instead of x.  Can you
    increase this more by using x-cubed?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>
    The controller is now more comfortable to handle, because the default position is to keep 
	it slightly tilted up.  One issue, however, is that when you set the kit on a table, Steve 
	will look down at the ground.  Can you detect when the CREATOR Kit is placed flat on a 
	table, and have Steve look straight ahead?
