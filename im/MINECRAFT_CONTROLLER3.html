  <p>In our last project, we improved our Minecraft controller code to make it
  simpler and more readible (and also more extensible). But, with the current
  code, our controller is awkward because it requires us to rotate it away from
  us (which is difficult to do) in order for our character to look down.</p>

  <p>In this project, we're going to improve that — we're going to modify the
  tilt functionality so that our character looking down while the controller is
  in the default position — horizontal or "flat on a table" — and have then we
  only need to rotate the controller towards us (which is easy) to have him
  start to look upwards.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section"><img class="bb" src=
 "img/Minecraft_Accel_4way_1button_bb.jpg" alt=""></div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>For this project, the changes to the code will be in the
  <code>while</code> loop, specifically around the <code>control.look()</code>
  function, which defines where the character is looking.</p>

  <p>In the previous 
  <a data-uid="mccontr2"></a> project, we used the x and y values of the accelerometer to control
  which direction we looked:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
    control.look(up=50*y, left=50*x)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>And that works...  But there are two things we can improve on:
  <ol>
  <li><p>
  Too hard to look down &mdash; to look down, you have to point the controller down, and it can be
  difficult to twist your wrists enough to tilt it fully down.  We can adjust this.
  </p></li> <li><p>
  Controller is not sensitive enough. Currently, when you tilt the controller a little, Steve moves a
  little and when you tilt a lot, Steve moves a lot.  That works reasonaly well, but the current
  code doesn't take that far enough.
  </p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point
  (with new changes highlighted with arrows):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control
import time

control.show()

keymap = {
    Button(23) : control.left,
    Button(14) : control.right,
    Button(18) : control.forward,
    Button(15) : control.backward,
    Button(7)  : control.smash,
    Button(24) : control.jump,
    }

accel = Accel()

while True:
    for button, action in keymap.items():
        action(release=(not button.is_pressed()))

    x, y, z = accel.forces()
*    y -= 0.3
*    control.look(up=150*y*abs(y), left=150*x*abs(x))
    
    time.sleep(0.01)

</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>The above hightlighted changes are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 24: we decrease the y value by a small amount (0.3).  Now, when we hold the kit
    at a more comfortable angle (with y pointing a little bit up) Steve won't move at all.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 25: previously we converted the accelerometer force to a reasonable amount to
    <code>look()</code>
    using the equation <code>50*x</code> (and likewise for <code>y</code>).  That makes a small
    value of <code>x</code> move Steve a little, and a large value move him a lot.  We can
    increase this effect by using x-squared &mdash; a small value will still move him a little, and
    a large value will move him even more.   To use x-squared, you would expect the the code
    to be <code>x*x</code>, but instead we use <code>x*abs(x)</code>.  The reason is that 
    <code>x*x</code> changes negative numbers to positive, which we don't want.  Our code that uses
    <code>abs()</code> keeps negative <code>x</code> values negative.
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Also on Line 25: 
    We've adjusted the multiplier from 50 to 150, but the choice here is just chosen by experimenting!</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Our new code makes Steve not look around when the kit is slightly tilted up.  Can you
    change this so that Steve doesn't look around when the kit is tilted slightly right?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We increased the sensitivity of the controller by using x-squared instead of x.  Can you
    increase this more by using x-cubed?</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
