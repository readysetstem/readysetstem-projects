  <p>In our <a data-uid="circuits"></a> concept, we discussed Ohm's Law, which
  defines the relationship between voltage, current and resistance. In this
  project, we're going to play around with different voltages, currents and
  resistances in order to test Ohm's Law and see how it works in a real
  circuit.</p>

  <p>To test Ohm's Law concepts, we're going to start with the LED circuit we
  built previously:</p><img class="schematic" style="width: 200px;" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png" alt="">

  <p>We'll change the voltage and resistance in the circuit, and see how it
  affects the current. Because we don't have any good tools to measure the
  amount of current flowing through the circuit, we'll rely on the LEDs to
  indicate how much current is flowing — in general, the less current that
  flows through an LED, the less bright it will appear; the more current
  flowing, the brighter it will appear (keep in mind that too much current will
  cause the LED to break...but we won't let that happen here).</p>

  <p>Here's a reminder of Ohm's Law:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><i>Voltage</i></strong> =
  <strong><i>Current</i></strong> x <strong><i>Resistance</i></strong></p>

  <p>By plugging in different numbers, we can see that:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>For a resistance that doesn't change, if we double the voltage, the
    current will double. And, as we discussed above, if the current doubles
    (increases) in our circuit, the LED will be <strong>brighter</strong>.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Alternatively, for a voltage that doesn't change, if we double the
    resistance, the current will be cut in half. And, as we discussed above, if
    the current is cut in half (decreases) in our circuit, the LED will be
    <strong>dimmer</strong>.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>With those ideas in mind, let's jump into our project!</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>We're going to start by building two identical LED circuits on the
  breadboard. Then, we'll experiment with changing the voltage and resistance
  through each of these circuits and see how it affects the current (the LED
  brightness). The reason for building two identical circuits is so we can
  change one of them, and then compare the LED brightness of the changed
  circuit to the LED brightness of the unchanged circuit.</p>
  <h3 class="step">Build two identical LED circuits.</h3>

  <p>Our two identical LED circuits will each use a 100 ohm resistor, just like
  the circuit we built previously. Here is what those two circuits should look
  like: <img class="bb" src="img/Tweaking_LED_100_ohms_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>Once the circuit is wired, both LEDs should be lit and each one should be
  just as bright as it was in the previous project.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It may appear that this is just one big circuit
  with two LEDs and two resistors, but it only looks that way because we are
  using a single wire from 3.3V power and a single wire to ground. Both circuits
  are being powered from the red rail and are grounded to the blue rail, but
  they are completely separate circuits. In fact, you'll see that if you remove
  either of the LED/resistor pairs (either circuit), the other one continues to
  work exactly as it should.</p>
  <h3 class="step">In one circuit, change the resistance.</h3>

  <p>Now that we have our two circuits wired, it's time to start playing with
  the resistance. For one of the circuits (we've chosen the circuit on the
  right in the diagram below), let's change the resistor from 100 ohms to 1000
  ohms (refer back to the resistor color codes in <a data-uid="circuits"></a>
  if you have any questions about which resistors to use): <img class="bb" src=
  "img/Tweaking_LED_1000_ohms_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>You should see that the LED with the larger resistor (the circuit with the
  higher resistance) has gotten noticeably dimmer than the LED attached to the
  smaller resistor (the circuit with the lower resistance). In this case, we've
  increased the resistance by 10 times, which — according to Ohm's Law — means
  we've decreased the current by 10 times. Decreasing the current makes the LED
  dimmer.</p>
  <h3 class="step">In one circuit, change the voltage.</h3>

  <p>Next, let's change the resistor back to 100 ohms so we once again have two
  identical circuits.</p>

  <p>Now, for one of the circuits (again, we've chosen the circuit on the right
  in the diagram below), let's change the voltage from 3.3V to 5V. We do this
  by moving the beginning of the circuit off the red power rail (so that the
  circuit is no longer being powered by the 3.3V on the red rail), and then
  powering that circuit using a wire from one of the 5V pins on the Lid
  Connector board.</p>

  <p>Here is what our circuits should now look like: <img class="bb" src=
  "img/Tweaking_LED_5V_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>You should see that the LED with the higher voltage (5V) has gotten
  brighter than the LED with the lower voltage (3.3V). In this case, we've
  increased the voltage, which — according to Ohm's Law — means we've increased
  the current. Increasing the current makes the LED brighter.</p><mark>Need to
  try this to see how noticeable the brightness change is</mark>

   <li>

    <p>The <strong>Your First Circuit Ready Set STEM Cell</strong> includes
    three resistors of different values (100 ohms, 1000 ohms, and 4700 ohms).
    On one of your circuits, try using each resistor with both 3.3V and 5V
    power. Which combination of voltage and resistance gives the brightest LED?
    Which gives the dimmest LED? Is it what you would expect given Ohm's
    Law?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Using Ohm's Law, which circuit would you expect to generate a greater
    current: an LED circuit using 1000 ohm resistor with 3.3V power or an LED
    circuit using 100 ohm resistor with 5V power? Once you have your theory,
    try wiring those two circuits side-by-side and see which generates the
    brighter LED. Was it the one you expected?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><mark>Check 5V LED</mark>Ohm's Law tells us that in a circuit with a
    fixed voltage, as the resistance decreases, current increases. In theory,
    if resistance were zero in a circuit, current would be infinite! Try
    removing the resistor in one of your circuits and replacing it with a wire.
    You'll notice that the LED gets very bright (and may get hot to the touch,
    so be careful). But, we don't have so much current in the circuit that the
    LED breaks. Why is that? Where is the resistance coming from to keep the
    current from getting too high?</p>
