  <p>In this project, we'll read the voltage from a wire attached to a GPIO
  input.

  <p>Before jumping into this project, we very strongly recommend that you read
  <a data-uid="gpioi"></a>, as these concepts will be the basis for this
  project and nearly all future Ready Set STEM projects.</p>

  <p>In the previous project, we saw how GPIOs can be used as outputs to
  control components attached to the Raspberry Pi (like our LED). GPIOs can
  also be used as inputs to take information from external components; that
  input can then be acted upon by the Raspberry Pi and appropriate actions can
  be taken.</p>
</div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">
  <h2 class="step">Start with a clean slate</h2>
  <p>First, we start with an empty breadboard, with power and ground wired from
  the Lid Connector Board, like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Just_Power_bb.jpg" alt=""> With our breadboard empty, here is how we
  build our circuit and then use code to get input from the button through the
  GPIO:

  <h2 class="step">Wire up two inputs</h2>
  <p>We'll use two different GPIO pins as inputs to show what reading an input
  looks like when connected to power or ground.  Connect GPIOs 14 and 18 to
  power and ground, respectively, as shown:

  <img class="bb" src="img/Inputs_bb.jpg" alt="">

 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">
 <p>Now, for the code:  
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Input
firstinput = Input(14)
secondinput = Input(18)
print(firstinput.is_on())
print(secondinput.is_on())
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>You may notice that this example is similar to the <a data-uid=
  "gpoutp"></a> example. But in this case, we configure the GPIOs as a <i>inputs</i>
  instead of <i>outputs</i> (and we're using two instead of one):</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>In Line 2 and 3: We're configuring the GPIOs as inputs.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>In Line 4 and 5: We're getting the state (the voltage) of the input, and printing it.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If everything was wired correctly, when you run the code, you should see:
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
True
False
</pre>
  </div>

<p>The <code>True</code> indicates that the first input was <i>on</i>.  For an
<code>Input()</code>, the default is that if it is <i>on</i>, that means it is <i>high</i> (that
is, 3.3V).  In otherwords, inputs are by default active high (as we discussed in 
  <a data-uid="gpioc"></a>).

 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li> <p>If you wire both GPIOs to 3.3V, and rerun the code, does it print
   out what you expect?
   </li> <li> <p> If you wire both GPIOs to ground, and rerun the code, does it print
   out what you expect?
   </li> <li> <p>Can you change the code to use different GPIO inputs?  More
   that two inputs?
   </li> <li> <p>What happens if you disconnect the GPIOs both power and ground
   (that is, don't hook them up at all) and rerun the code?  Hint: you may not
   get the same values each time, rerun it multiple times to see.
   </li>
  </ol>
