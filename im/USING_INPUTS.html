  <p>Before jumping into this project, we very strongly recommend that you read
  <a data-uid="gpioi"></a>, as these concepts will be the basis for this
  project and nearly all future Ready Set STEM projects.</p>

  <p>In the previous tutorial, we talked about the fact that GPIOs can
  be used as inputs to take information from external components. They do this
  by reading a voltage at the GPIO input pin. In this project, we'll attach a
  wire to a GPIO pin, and then read the voltage from our code.

</div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">
  <h2 class="step">Start with a clean slate.</h2>
  <p>First, we start with an empty breadboard, with power and ground wired from
  the Lid Connector Board &mdash; like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Just_Power_bb.jpg" alt=""> 

  <h2 class="step">Wire two inputs.</h2>
  <p>For this project, we'll wire two different GPIO pins as inputs &mdash; one wired
  directly to 3.3V (power) and one wired directly to 0V (ground). Connect GPIO14 
  and GPIO18 to power and ground, respectively, as shown:

  <img class="bb" src="img/Inputs_bb.jpg" alt="">

 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">
 <p>Now that we have two GPIO inputs wired, we can write the code that will read
 those inputs and print the state (high or low) of the GPIO. Here's what the code
 will look like:
   
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Input
firstinput = Input(14)
secondinput = Input(18)
print(firstinput.is_on())
print(secondinput.is_on())
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>You may notice that this example is similar to the <a data-uid=
  "gpoutp"></a> example, but in this case we configure the GPIOs as a <i>inputs</i>
  instead of <i>outputs</i> (and we're using two instead of one):</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>In Lines 2 and 3: We're configuring the GPIOs as inputs.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>In Lines 4 and 5: We're getting the state (the voltage) of the input, and printing it.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If everything is wired correctly, when you run the code, you should see:
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
True
False
</pre>
  </div>

<p>The <code>True</code> in the first line indicates that the first input was <i>on</i>. For an
<code>Input()</code>, <i>on</i> generally means that the GPIO is reading <i>high</i> (or 3.3V).
<code>False</code> in the second line indicates that the second input was <i>off</i>. For an
<code>Input()</code>, <i>off</i> generally means that the GPIO is reading <i>low</i> (or 0V). 
In other words, inputs are by default active high (as we discussed in <a data-uid="gpioc"></a>).

<p>Given that the first input was wired to power and the second was wired to ground, this is
exactly the result we should expect.
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li> <p>If you wire both GPIOs to 3.3V, and rerun the code, does it print
   out what you expect?
   </li> <li> <p> If you wire both GPIOs to ground, and rerun the code, does it print
   out what you expect?
   </li> <li> <p>Can you change the code (and the wiring) to use different GPIO inputs? 
   How about more than two inputs?
   </li> <li> <p>What happens if you disconnect power and ground from the GPIOs completely
   and rerun the code? Hint: you may not get the same values each time &mdash; rerun it multiple 
   times to see. Remember our discussion about "Floating Inputs?"
