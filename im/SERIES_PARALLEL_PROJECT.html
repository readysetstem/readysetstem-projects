  <p>To investigate series and parallel circuits further, lets start again with
  our LED circuit:</p><img class="schematic" style="width: 200px;" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png" alt="">

  <p>In our previous project, we swapped out the resistor in the circuit to
  change the current (which changed the brightness of the LED). Now, we can use
  our knowledge of series and parallel circuits to swap out the resistor for
  more than one resistor, in different combinations of series and parallel.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>To build this circuit, we'll again start with two identical LED circuits.
  Then, we'll experiment with changing the voltage and resistance.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Build two identical LED circuits.</h2>

  <p>Start by building two LED circuits that are equivalent to the circuits
  we've previously built. Each circuit will use a 100 ohm resistor: <img class=
  "bb" src="img/Series_Parallel_bb.jpg" alt=""> Both LEDs should be just as
  bright as they were before.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Put two resistors in series.</h2>

  <p>For one of the circuits (we've chosen the circuit on the right in the
  diagram below), change the resistor from a single 100 ohms to two 100 ohms
  resistors in series: <img class="bb" src=
  "img/Series_Parallel_In_Series_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>This will increase the resistance which will decrease the current, which
  makes the LED dimmer. Note that, compared to the last project, the difference
  in brightness will be slight (we used a large difference in resistance last
  project)</p>
  <h2 class="step">Put two resistors in parallel.</h2>

  <p>For one of the circuits (we've chosen the circuit on the right in the
  diagram below), rewire the two series resistors as two resistors in parallel:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Series_Parallel_In_Parallel_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>This will decrease the resistance which will increase the current, which
  makes the LED brighter. Again note that the difference in brightness will be
  slight.</p>

 <div class="section" id="challenge">

  <p>The <strong>Your First Circuit Ready Set STEM Cell</strong> includes four
  100 ohm resistors (in addition to the 1000 ohms and 4700 ohms resistors). The
  following challenges will modify your LED/resistor circuit:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Compare four 100 ohm resistors in series to one 1000 ohm. Is there any
    noticeable difference in brightness?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Add 100 ohm resistors in parallel, one at a time, until there are four
    in parallel. Notice the brightness change as each one is added (each new
    resistor can be added in parallel while the LED is on, so you will see the
    brightness change right as each resistor is added).</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Put a 100 ohm resistor in <i>parallel</i> with a 1000 ohm resistor. How
    does the brightness compare to a 100 ohm resistor alone or a 1000 ohm
    resistor alone? Why?</p>
   </li>
