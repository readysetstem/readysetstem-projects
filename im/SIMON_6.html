  <p>In this project, we continue the development of our Simon Says

  <p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was

  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point
  (with new changes highlighted with arrows) — it should run similarly to the

  <p>Next, we need to insert our sounds into two locations — where we flash the
  sequence of LEDs for the player and where the player presses a button while
  repeating the sequence. Here is what those two code blocks should be updated
  to:</p>

  <p><mark>NEED CODE HERE</mark>
  
  <p>Here, we've added code to play sounds:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 13, we initialize <code>Notes()</code>s, one note that
    corresponds to each LED.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 34, we play the note corresponding to the LED in the sequence.
    At this line, we previously just paused with a <code>time.sleep()</code>.
    Now, we play the correct note for exactly the amount of time that we
    previously were pausing.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 54 and 58, we play the note that corresponds to the button that
    was pressed. The first line we've added starts the note playing, and the
    second line stops it. This way, the note will play for the entire time the
    user has the button pressed.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>The notes we've chosen are at a relatively low volume for the small
    speaker in the CREATOR Kit. Higher pitch notes will sound louder on the
    speaker.  Try changing the pitch of all of the notes to
    the same notes two octaves higher.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>When the user is trying to repeat the sequence, the notes will play for
    as long as the button is pressed. Instead, change the code to only play the
    note for exactly 0.4 seconds.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Instead of notes, change the code to use <code>Speech()</code> that
    corresponds to the color of each led. That is, when you press the button
    next to the red LED, have the speaker say the word "Red".</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Instead of notes, change the code to use <code>Sound()</code>. You could
    have an animal sound for each button. Some animal sounds available are:
    <span class="nospell">"Meow.wav", "Horse.wav", "Rooster.wav", "Kitten.wav",
    "Cricket.wav", "Dog1.wav", "Dog2.wav", "Goose.wav", "Owl.wav", "Bird.wav",
    and "Duck.wav"</span>.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
