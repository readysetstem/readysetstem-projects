  <p>In this project, you're going to create your first electric circuit using
  a few basic components that we've provided in the kit.</p>

  <p>In <a data-uid="electronics"></a>, we provided a basic overview of how and
  why an electric circuit works. Now, let's jump into a real-life example of
  building a circuit. We've provided all of the parts you will need to build
  this first circuit as part of the Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit, in the bag
  marked <strong>Your First Circuit Ready Set STEM Cell</strong>. You'll find
  this bag (along with all the other project parts you'll need later) in the
  box marked <strong>OPEN LATER — Project Parts</strong>.</p>

  <p>Open the box/bag and let's get started!</p>

  <p>The purpose of this circuit is to power and illuminate a "light emitting
  diode" (or "LED" for short). An LED (pronounced "L-E-D") is a light source
  that looks and works a bit like a lightbulb, in that they both light up when
  you run electric current through them. So, this circuit will work similarly
  to the circuit discussed in <a data-uid="electronics"></a>, with the battery
  and the lightbulb.</p>

  <p><i>Hardware</i> is a fancy name for electronic components. Typically,
  we refer to a very big circuit or an entire device (like a whole computer) as
  hardware, but in reality, even just a single electronic component is also
  considered hardware.</p>

  <p>To build the hardware for this project, we'll need the following three
  components (all provided in the bag marked <strong>Your First Circuit Ready
  Set STEM Cell</strong>), and shown at the top of this page:</p>

  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>3 Volt Battery.</strong>  Inside it's own plastic bag is a 
  round flat battery that we'll be using for the next couple projects.</li>
  <li><p><strong>100 Ohm Resistor.</strong>  There are several resistors in 
  the bag that look similar to the one shown at the top of this page (that funky
  symbol after the number 100 is referred to as "Ohm").  We'll talk more about the 
  differences between the resistors in an upcoming tutorial, but for now, you 
  want one of the resistors that has the color bands shown in the picture 
  above (there are four of these exact colored resistors in the bag).</li>
  <li><p><strong>Red LED.</strong>  There are two red LEDs in the bag.  We'll need 
  one of them for this project.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Okay, let's give this a try, step-by-step...</p>
  <h3 class="step">Connect the Resistor and LED to the Battery</h3>

  <p>Using your fingers, pinch one lead of the resistor (the "leads" are the
  metal wires on either side) to the positive (+) side of the battery and pinch
  the shorter lead of the LED (one of the leads is longer than the other) to
  the other side of the battery (we refer to this as the "negative" side).</p>

  <p>Like this:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Circuit_connect_battery_bb.png" alt=""></p>
  <h3 class="step">Touch the Other Leads of the Resistor and LED Together</h3>

  <p>Using your free hand, touch the other leads of the resistor and LED
  together, as indicated below:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Circuit_complete_bb.png" alt="">

  <p>At this point, the LED should be lit, like this:</p><img src=

  <p>Congratulations...you just built your first electric circuit!</p>

    Wiring LEDs
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>An important concept to understand about LEDs is that they are
    "unidirectional" — in other words, they only allow electric current to flow
    in one direction. If you hook up the LED backwards — in the way that
    electric current won't be allowed to flow through it — it will not
    illuminate and no current will flow through <i>any</i> of the circuit (remember,
    if electric current isn't flowing at a point in the circuit, it's not
    going to be flowing anywhere in the circuit).</p>

    <p>There are three ways to determine the correct way to orient the LED:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>

      <p>Look at the leads (the metal legs on either side of the LED). One is
      going to be a bit longer than the other. For the LED to work correctly,
      the longer lead should be closest to the power source and the shorter
      lead should be closest to ground.</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>There is a raised ridge that runs around the base of the LED bulb.
      That ridge is flattened on one side of the bulb. The side of the bulb
      where the ridge is flattened should be facing closer to the ground than
      to power in the circuit.</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>Just hook it up one way and hope you get lucky! If that doesn't work,
      reverse it. Keep in mind that if there are other issues with your
      circuit, it's possible that the LED won't illuminate in either case, and
      you still won't know if the LED is oriented correctly. If that happens,
      we suggest reverting back to #1 or #2 to ensure the LED is oriented
      correctly so you can rule that out as a possible problem in your
      circuit.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>

    Why the Resistor?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>You'll notice that if you remove the resistor from the circuit above and
    attach the LED directly to the battery, the LED still lights. Which means
    you're probably wondering why we need the resistor at all?</p>

    <p>Often, electronic components can only handle certain maximum voltages
    and/or currents. In general, the manufacturer of the component does a bunch
    of testing to determine how much voltage and/or current the part can handle
    before it's at risk of being damaged or working improperly. When a power
    supply puts out more voltage/current than the part can handle, a resistor
    in the circuit can reduce the voltage/current to ensure the part isn't
    damaged and works properly.</p>

    <p>In this particular circuit, we use the resistor to reduce the amount of
    electric current flowing through the circuit so that the LED doesn't break.
    While having (or not having) the resistor in this circuit won't make much
    of a difference, when using other power sources — like we'll be doing in
    future projects — ensuring we use the proper resistance in the
    circuit is much more important.</p>

    Shorting Wires
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Sometimes your circuit won't work and you just can't figure out the
    problem. When this happens, it's a good idea to verify that wires and
    components aren't touching each other in places where you don't intend them
    to ("a short circuit"). Electric current flowing through a circuit is going
    to look for the easiest way to get to the lowest point of voltage (usually
    ground), and sometimes — if wires or components are touching where you
    don't expect them to — you may be inadvertently creating a new path for
    electric current to flow and that electric current may be traveling in ways
    that bypass your components and give you unexpected results.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>We discussed how current will only flow through the LED in one
    direction. Try testing this for yourself by reversing the LED and seeing
    what happens (or doesn't happen).</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Do you think current will flow through the resistor in both
    directions? Try reversing the orientation of the resistor and see if the LED
    still illuminates.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>You flipped the LED and resistor around and saw what happened in
    those cases. What do you think will happen if you flip the battery
    around?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We mentioned that if you remove the resistor, the circuit still works -
    try it and see for yourself. Did you notice anything different about the
    LED between the circuit with the resistor and the circuit without?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Try wrapping a rubber band (not included) around the battery and LED to
    hold them together (without the resistor). This will keep your LED on,
    without having to hold it together with your fingers.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>With your rubber band wrapped LED circuit, slide a piece of paper
    between the battery and one lead of the LED. The LED should go off.
    Now you can turn on the LED only when you want, simply by removing the
    paper. Can you figure out why the LED goes off when the paper is
    inserted?</p>
