  <h1>Coding Minecraft</h1>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, Minecraft has its own API that can be used to
  control and manipulate the Minecraft world. The API is called
  <code>mcpi</code>, which stands for Minecraft Pi. The mcpi API is a set of
  functions to query and control the player and the environment in the
  Minecraft world.</p>

  <p>Note: There is an mcpi API downloadable online, which is slightly
  different from the one available on the CREATOR Kit. The CREATOR Kit
  has an enhanced version that includes functions for controlling the movement
  of the Minecraft player, determining the direction the player is looking, and
  showing/hiding the Minecraft window.
  </p>

  <p>A typical Minecraft program will consist of four parts:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Initialization Code</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Starting Minecraft</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Connecting to the Minecraft Server</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The Game Loop</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Initialization Code</h2>

  <p>The first thing we typically do in any program (including our Minecraft
  programs) is to import the modules and functions we'll need for our code. The
  set of functions that the Ready Set STEM uses for Minecraft programs is
  called <code>rstem.mcpi</code>, so in addition to any other functions we will
  need to import, we'll typically either import the entire
  <code>rstem.mcpi</code> module or we'll import specific functions within the
  <code>rstem.mcpi</code> module.</p>
  <h2>Starting Minecraft</h2>

  <p>In order to start Minecraft, we use a function within the
  <code>rstem.mcpi</code> module called <code>control.show()</code>. This
  function will be used in pretty much every Minecraft program to start the
  game prior to executing our game loop.</p>
  <h2>Connecting to the Minecraft Server</h2>

  <p>Once the Minecraft game has been started and we have our Minecraft window
  open, we next need to connect our code to the Minecraft server so that we can
  interact with the existing game. This is accomplished using a function from
  the <code>rstem.mcpi</code> module called
  <code>minecraft.Minecraft.create()</code>.</p>

  <p>Note that not every Minecraft function will require that this step was
  completed, but many do, so it's good to get in
  the habit of including it even if you don't use it.</p>
  <h2>The Game Loop</h2>

  <p>Once we have our initialization complete and we've started the Minecraft
  game, we then create the game loop that will house the logic for our code. In
  many cases, the game loop will be a <code>while</code> loop that will
  run forever (until we manually stop it).</p>
  <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

  <p>Putting all three steps together, the basic framework of our Minecraft
  programs will look something like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

while True:
    ...
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>All of our subsequent Minecraft projects will take the form above.</p>

  <p>For more detailed information about these — and all — Minecraft APIs,
  check out the API documentation linked from the RDE above.</p>
