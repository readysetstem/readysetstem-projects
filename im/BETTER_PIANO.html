    <p>In this project, we improve on the Simple Piano we created in the
    previous project by monitoring the buttons and playing the notes for the
    duration of the button press.</p>

    <p>Using the same hardware setup from the <a data-uid="simplepiano"></a>
    project, we can turn our CREATOR Kit into a mini-keyboard. We will modify
    the code so that each time you press one of the buttons on the
    CREATOR Kit, the corresponding note plays for as long as the button is
    held.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="hw">
    <p>Your breadboard should still have the circuit we wired in the
    <a data-uid="manybuttons"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it
    should look like: <img class="bb" src="img/Many_Buttons_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="sw">

    <p>Here, we fix the popping/crackling sound from the previous project.  Instead of trying to
	<code>play()</code> the note whenever the button is pressed down, we only play the note if the
	button is pressed <i>and</i> it is not already playing.  That way, it only starts playing
	right when it is pressed.  
	
	<p>In addition, if the button is <i>not</i> pressed, we
	<code>stop()</code> playing the note.  This only has an affect if the note
	was already playing (right after we release the button).  If the note
	wasn't playing, stopping it doesn't do anything.

    <p>Here is what the code should look like:</p>
    <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
      <textarea>from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.sound import Note
import time

buttons_and_notes = [
	[Button(14), Note('A')],
	[Button(15), Note('B')],
	[Button(25), Note('C')],
	[Button(7), Note('D')],
    ]

while True:
	for button, note in buttons_and_notes:
        if button.is_pressed():
            if not note.is_playing():
                note.play(duration=None)
        else:
            note.stop()
    time.sleep(0.01)
</textarea>
    </div>
	<p>There's one new function used above that we haven't mentioned.  The function <code>is_playing()</code>
	tells us whether or not a given note is currently playing.
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="challenge">
    <ol>
      <li>

		<p>We used the new function <code>is_playing()</code> in the code above.  However, the
		code can be written without it.  How?  Hint: You'll likely need a variable (or
		variables) to keep track of whether or not each note is playing.
      </li>
      <li>

		<p>Pushing multiple buttons at the same time will play notes simultaneously.  Can you
		modify the code to only play one note at a time?
      </li>
      <li>

		<p>Your piano can easily be converted to a sound machine by playing <code>Sound</code>s
		instead of <code>Note</code>s.  How?
      </li>
      <li>

		<p>Your piano plays one note for each button that is pressed.  Can you play more than one
		note <i>at the same time</i> for each button?
      </li>
      <li>

		<p>Can you modify your piano so that the first three buttons play a
		note when pressed, and the note keeps on playing even when the button
		is released.
		Then, if the fourth button is pressed, stop all notes from playing.
