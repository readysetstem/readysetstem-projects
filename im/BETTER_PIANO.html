  <p>In this project, we improve on the Simple Piano we created in the previous
  project by monitoring the buttons and playing the notes for the duration of
  the button press (instead of for a predefined time period).</p>

  <p>Using the same hardware setup from the <a data-uid="simplepiano"></a>
  project, we can turn our CREATOR Kit into a mini-keyboard. We will modify the
  code so that each time you press one of the buttons on the CREATOR Kit, the
  corresponding note plays for as long as the button is held.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>Your breadboard should still have the circuit we wired in the <a data-uid=
  "simplepiano"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it should look like:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Many_Buttons_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>Here, we fix the popping/crackling sound from the previous project when a
  button is held down. Instead of trying to <code>play()</code> the note each
  time we see that the button is pressed down, we will instead only only play
  the note when we see a button press <i>and</i> the note is not already
  playing. This way, we only start the note once at the start of the button
  press and aren't continually restarting the note each time through the
  loop.</p>

  <p>In addition, if the button is <i>not</i> pressed, we <code>stop()</code>
  playing the note. This only has an effect if the note was already playing
  (right after we release the button). If the note wasn't playing, stopping it
  doesn't do anything.</p>

  <p>Here is what the code should look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.sound import Note
import time

buttons_and_notes = [
    [Button(14), Note('C')],
    [Button(15), Note('D')],
    [Button(25), Note('E')],
    [Button(7), Note('G')],
    ]

while True:
    for button, note in buttons_and_notes:
        if button.is_pressed():
            if not note.is_playing():
                note.play(duration=None)
        else:
            note.stop()
    time.sleep(0.01)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>There's one new function used above that we haven't mentioned before. The
  function <code>is_playing()</code> tells us whether or not a given note is
  currently playing, which allows us to verify whether the note is currently
  playing before deciding whether or not to start it.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>We used the new function <code>is_playing()</code> in the code above.
    However, the code can be written without it. How? Hint: You'll likely need
    a variable (or variables) to keep track of whether or not each note is
    playing. Can you rewrite the code above without
    <code>is_playing()</code>?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Pushing multiple buttons at the same time will play notes
    simultaneously. Can you modify the code to only play one note at a
    time?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Your piano can easily be converted to a sound machine by playing
    <code>Sound</code>s instead of <code>Note</code>s. Give it a try!</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Your piano plays one note for each button that is pressed. Can you play
    more than one note <i>at the same time</i> for each button?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you modify your piano so that the first three buttons play a note
    when pressed, and the note keeps on playing even when the button is
    released. Then, if the fourth button is pressed, stop all notes from
    playing.</p>
