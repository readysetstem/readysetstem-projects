  <p>In the previous project, we started creating an accelerometer application 
  that recorded each time the CREATOR Kit is tapped. One issue, though, was that the
  program was too sensitive &mdash; it recorded too many taps.</p>

  <p>In this project, we'll filter out all of those extra taps.  To do this,
  we'll look at any group of taps that were registered close together in a short
  time period, and assume that they were all part of a single tap.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>For this project, we'll only need the accelerometer and speaker.  Here is what your 
  breadboard should look like:</p>

  <p>Here are the new additions that we've made to the code and highlighted above:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 33 through 38, we filter out all the extra taps that occur from
    the vibration of the kit. In a <code>for</code> loop, we make a new list
    <code>filtered_tap_ticks</code> that does not include any taps that were 20
    ticks or less from the previous tick.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 41 through 45, we make the ticks relative to the previous tick.
    That is, before, the tick was the time from when recording started until
    the tap occurred. After this code, we'll have a new list
    <code>relative_tap_ticks</code> that is the time in ticks from the previous
    tap.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 47 through 49, we print out the taps in each of the list that
    we've made.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you try this, you'll see three sets of numbers printed in the Output Window.
  The first is the list of raw taps, the same as what we saw in the previous project.
  The second set of numbers is the <i>filtered</i> taps, which removes all the taps 
  close in time, and leaves us with the start time of each new tap.  Finally, we have
  the <i>relative</i> tap timing, which tells us the amount of time between each
  successive tap.
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>We used the arbitrary number 20 to filter out extra taps. If the number
    is too small, then it we won't filter out all of the extra taps. How small
    can this number be so that when you tap the kit once, you still see only
    one <code>filtered_tap_ticks</code>?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>You can also <i>increase</i> the tap filter number (20). However, if the
    number is too large, then two fast taps in a row will only be recognized as
    one tap. How high can you increase the number so that the program still
    recognizes individual taps when you record two fast taps in a row.</p>

  </ol>
