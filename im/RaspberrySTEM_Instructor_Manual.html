      <h2>Intro to the RaspberrySTEM&trade;</h2>

      <p>The RaspberrySTEM&trade; is a programming and electronics
      kit that provides a complete platform to design and build
      electronics projects that interact with the real-world - and
      even solve real-world problems. The RaspberrySTEM&trade; is
      built on the Raspberry Pi&reg; single board computer, a
      popular computer board with an active online community
      worldwide.</p>

      <p>Paired with a programming and electronics curriculum
      geared towards students in 4th through 12th grade, the
      RaspberrySTEM&trade; is a cutting-edge learning tool that is
      both fun and functional.</p>

      <h2>Who is this manual for?</h2>

      <p>This manual is written for educators that want to bring a
      programming and electronics curriculum to their classroom,
      after-school enrichment program, extra-curricular group, or
      technology camp.</p>Teacher prerequisites

      <ul>
        <li>Basic understanding of electronics, specifically the
        concepts of:</li>

        <li style=
        "list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">
        <ul>
            <li>Electricity is a flow of charged particles</li>

            <li>The water analogy for explaining electronics</li>

            <li>Voltage and current</li>

            <li>The primary parts of a computer: Processor, memory,
            and IO.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Basic understanding of programming, specifically in
        Python, including:</li>

      <h2>How to use this manual</h2>

      <p>TBD</p>

      <p>Projects are guides. Split into discussions/activities.
      Intended to jumpstart larger self-guided projects.</p>

      <p>Projects a split in to roughly 1 hours blocks, but
      strongly depend on age, experience, group size, and other
      factors.</p>

      <p>Projects should be adapted to the specific needs of the
      class and environment. Projects are intended to be
      self-contained &ndash; generally each project teaches a new
      skill or feature. When combined together, a group of projects
      can create a full new interactive product.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>About our Curriculum</h2>

      <p>The goal of this manual is to provide a framework for
      using the RaspberrySTEMTM in a structured educational
      setting. Projects are only suggestions and can be readily
      modified for the target age group and level of experience.
      They can be mixed and matched to accommodate specific subject
      matter and to adhere to the time constraints of the course.
      Throughout the projects, we will make recommendations for how
      the projects can be modified and adapted for different age
      groups and abilities.</p>

          Demonstration: LED throwie (with resistor) &ndash; one of
          the simplest circuits

          <ul>
            <li>Build the circuit as shown, using your hands. This
            can be done by pinching one lead of the the resistor
            and one lead of the LED around the battery with the
            left hand, and pinch the remaining LED and resistor
            leads together with the right hand.</li>

            <li>Note: Current will only flow through the LED in one
            direction, therefore you must connect it up correctly
            (no harm done if you don't, but it won't work). The
            cathode of the LED (has the shorter lead, and has a
            flat side) should be connected to the negative side of
            the battery.</li>

            <li>Note: An LED throwie can be made without the
            resistor, however it is considered bad practice to do
            so as it either it can possibly damage either the
            battery or LED (the resistor is used to limit the
            current through the circuit to a reasonable level).
            But, as the LED throwies are often only temporarily,
            they are often made without the resistor. In this
            exercise, though, it makes sense to teach the proper
            way to connect up an LED.</li>

          Assemble the RaspberrySTEM&trade; CREATOR Lid

          <ul>
            <li>Attach the Connector PCB to to the Lid with two
            nuts and bolts. The bolts should be pointed
            upwards.</li>

            <li>Attach the CREATOR Lid to the Raspberry Pi with the
            ribbon cable.</li>

            <li>Snap the Lid onto the RaspberrySTEM&trade;
            Base.</li>
          </ul>Building Your First Circuit on a Breadboard

          <ul>
            <li>Connect the 3.3V power and ground (GND) from the
            CREATOR Lid Connector to the breadboard power rails.
            The 3.3V should be hooked up to the positive
            &ldquo;+&rdquo; (red) rail, and the GND should be
            hooked up to the negative &ldquo;-&rdquo; (blue)
            rail.</li>

            <li>Build the circuit as shown in the previous example,
            in two steps:</li>

            <li style=
            "list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">
            <ul>
                <li>First, plug the resistor/LED connection into a
                single 5-pin column of the breadboard (previously
                held with the right hand). Continue to hold the
                left hand with the battery. The LED should light
                up.</li>

                <li>Second, remove the battery and instead hook the
                leads that were connected to the battery to the
                positive and negative. The LED should light
                up.</li>
              </ul>

          What is the LED Matrix RaspberrySTEM&trade; Cell?<br>
          It consists of:

          <ul>
            <li>A LED Matrix driver PCB &ndash; a circuit board,
            that receives data from the Raspberry Pi, and displays
            it on an LED Matrix using a small low-power
            micro-controller (Atmel ATTiny48</li>

            <li>An LED Matrix &ndash; a grid of LEDs, where for
            each row the anode (positive-side) of the LEDs are
            connected together. LED matrices can only show one
            unique row of LEDs lit at one time, therefore the
            micro-controller is required to sequence through each
            row one at a time. This occurs faster than the eye can
            perceive (through the eye's persistence of vision), and
            therefore appears to be a solid image.</li>

            <li>Communication from the Raspberry Pi to the LED
            Matrix RaspberrySTEM&trade; Cell occurs over the SPI
            bus</li>

            <li>The SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a common
            interface for sending data between processors and other
            ICs.</li>

            <li>The micro-controller stores the brightness level of
            each LED, on a scale from 0-15. In order to update the
            full LED Matrix display, the Raspberry Pi must send 64
            (i.e., 8 x 8) brightness levels, one for each LED, to

        In your game loop, check if the x_force is greater than some threshold.
        If so, increase x a little bit.  Likewise, if the x_force is lower than
        some threshold, decrease x.  <p> 
        The effect should be that tilting the
        board left and right move the dot to the left and right.  Adjust the
        threshold  and step (the amount of the increase or decrease) so that the dot moves at a
        reasonable rate.<p>
          <pre class="code">
from rstem.accel import Accel
</pre>
        Note that the dot will just run right off the screen.  It'll come back,
        though.
