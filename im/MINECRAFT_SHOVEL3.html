 <p>In this project, we're going to expand on our previous two shovel projects.
 Instead of just smashing the single block that we hit, when we hit a block,
 we'll smash that block plus all the other blocks within a defined
 radius of that block. This will demonstrate how the Minecraft API can be used
 to start doing more interesting types of modifications to the game world.</p>
 </div><div id="hw" class="section">

 <p>The hardware configuration for this project is exactly the same as the
  previous project â€” a single button mapped to GPIO24:

 </div><div id="sw" class="section">

 <p><mark>Where is the concept on creating functions?  Was that removed?  Do we 
 want to put it back just before this project?</mark>
 <p>In this project, we're going to create an external function that will control
 what happens every time we attempt to smash a block (or dig). This function
 will take three arguments:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>

   <p>The first will be the Minecraft object (<code>mc</code>) that we use to
   interact with the Minecraft server;</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>The second will be the position of the block that was hit; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>The radius we want to smash around the block we hit.</p>
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>Here is what that function will look like:</p>
 <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
  <textarea>
def dig(mc, pos, radius):
    r_vector = Vec3(radius,radius,radius)
    mc.setBlocks(pos - r_vector, pos + r_vector, block.AIR)
</textarea>
 </div>

 <p>Here's how the code works:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>

   <p>On Line 1, we define our function, called "dig" with the three arguments
   we discuss above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>On Line 2, we create a variable called "r_vector" (for "radius vector),
   which defines a 3-dimensional space using our predefined radius value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>On Line 3, we use the <code>.setBlocks()</code> function to modify all
   the blocks in the r_vector radius around the location of the hit block.</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Full Code</h2>

  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point
  (with new changes highlighted with arrows):</p>
 <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
  <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control, block
from rstem.mcpi.vec3 import Vec3
import time

control.show()
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
button = Button(24)

*radius = 1

*def dig(mc, pos, radius):
*    r_vector = Vec3(radius,radius,radius)
*    mc.setBlocks(pos - r_vector, pos + r_vector, block.AIR)

while True:
    if button.presses():
        control.hit(duration=0.2)

    hits = mc.events.pollBlockHits()
    for hit in hits:
*        dig(mc, hit.pos, radius)

    time.sleep(0.01)

   <li>

    <p>Assuming you still have your controller wired up, add this shovel code to 
	the Minecraft controller code (<a data-uid="mccontr3"></a> project) to add 
	shovel functionality to one of your controller buttons.
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
    Change the radius to create a larger shovel.
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
    Add (or reuse) 2 buttons: one button should increase the radius, the other
    one should decrease it.  Now you'll have a shovel of varying size!
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
    Instead of turning the blocks that were hit into Air, turn them into something
    else (say, Brick, perhaps).  Now your code works as if you are placing
        blocks!
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
     Our <code>dig()</code> function dug a perfect cube, but that's not the
     only shape you can dig.  Instead of using <code>setBlocks</code>, use
     multiple <code>setBlock()</code> calls to dig a different shape.
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
     Add some randomness &mdash; when digging with <code>setBlock()</code> you
     don't always have to turn the block into Air.  Use a random function to
     change it into Air half the time, and a different block type the other
     half of the time.
