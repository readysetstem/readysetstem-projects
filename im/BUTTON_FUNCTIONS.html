  <h1>Pressing Your Buttons</h1>

  <p>The <code>Button()</code> function returns a button object, and with that
  object you have access to a full set of button functions. To use the
  <code>Button()</code> function, as we have done throughout the guide, you
  simply call:</p>
  <pre>
Button(<i>pin</i>)
</pre>

  <p>where <code><i>pin</i></code> is the number of the GPIO pin that is
  labeled on the Lid Connector Board. The simplest thing we can do with a
  button, as we've done previously, is to see if the button is pressed:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
my_button = Button(14)
print(my_button.is_pressed())
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The above checks (and prints out) if the button attached to GPIO14 is
  pressed.</p>

  <p>The <code>is_pressed()</code> function is simple and easy to use, but has
  a couple issues. One issue is that if our code isn't checking very frequently
  if the button is pressed, it can miss a press. For example, say we write some
  code that checks once a second to see if the button is pressed. If a user
  pushes and releases the button quickly (say in a quarter of a second), it is
  likely the code will miss the button press &mdash; it might check before and
  after the button is pressed, but not check during the press.</p>

  <p>The <code>Button()</code> object fixes this problem with a couple new functions. The
  function <code>presses()</code> returns the number of times the button has
  been pressed since the last time the function was called. Similarly, the
  function <code>releases()</code> returns the number of times the button has
  been released since the last time the function was called. For example, if
  you run the following code, and push the button several times while it is
  running (during the <code>sleep()</code>, the output will be the number of
  presses:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
import time
my_button = Button(14)
time.sleep(3)
print(my_button.presses())
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Waiting for Presses</h1>

  <p>There are often times when you don't want to do anything in your code
  except wait until a certain button is pressed. A simple way to do this is
  highlighted with arrows below:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
import time
my_button = Button(14)
*while my_button.presses() == 0:
*    time.sleep(0.01)
print("The button was pressed!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The above code will wait until the button is pressed (that is, the
  <code>while</code> loop keeps running while there are zero
  <code>presses()</code>, and then it outputs a message.</p>

  <p>The Button object provides a convenience function, <code>wait()</code> to
  do this for you, in a more efficient way:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
import time
my_button = Button(14)
*my_button.wait()
print("The button was pressed!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>Button()</code> object also provides a function,
  <code>wait_many(buttons)</code> that will wait for any button in a list of
  <code>buttons</code> to be pressed. But, because <code>wait_many()</code>
  works with a bunch of buttons together, and not a specific button, the way
  you call it is a little different. To call it, you need to call
  <code>Button.wait_many(buttons)</code>. For example, say you had the same
  four buttons hooked up as in the <a data-uid="manybuttons"></a> project.
  Then, to wait for any one of them to be pressed, you would use the following code:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
my_buttons = [Button(14), Button(15), Button(25), Button(7)]
pressed_button = Button.wait_many(my_buttons)
print("Button", pressed_button, "was pressed!")
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>
</body>
</html>
