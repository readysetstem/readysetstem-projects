  <p>In this project, we create a text-to-speech (TTS) sound machine. When a
  button is pressed, we'll say a different phrase for each button.</p>

  <p>Your breadboard should still have the circuit we wired in the <a data-uid=
  "simplepiano"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it should look like:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Many_Buttons_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>For our sound machine, we will start with the code from the previous piano
  project <a data-uid="betterpiano"></a>, but we'll replace <code>Note()</code>
  with <code>Speech()</code>:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.sound import Speech
import time

buttons_and_speech = [
        [Button(14), Speech("What's brown and sticky?  A stick.")],
        [Button(15), Speech("What do you call cheese that isn't yours?  Nacho Cheese.")],
        [Button(25), Speech("When is a door not a door? When it's ajar.")],
        [Button(7), Speech("Why do gorillas have big nostrils?  Because they have big fingers.")],
    ]

while True:
    for button, speech in buttons_and_speech:
        if button.is_pressed():
            if not speech.is_playing():
                speech.play(duration=None)
        else:
            speech.stop()
    time.sleep(0.01)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Give it a try!</p>

  <p>While that works, you probably noticed that unfortunately you have to hold
  down the button for the entire time that the speech plays. It would be nice
  if the speech would start playing when the button was pressed, and just play
  until it finished, regardless if we held down the button or not. We can
  actually simplify our code to do this â€” we only need to remove the code that
  stops the sound from playing when the button is released:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.sound import Speech
import time

buttons_and_speech = [
        [Button(14), Speech("What's brown and sticky?  A stick.")],
        [Button(15), Speech("What do you call cheese that isn't yours?  Nacho Cheese.")],
        [Button(25), Speech("When is a door not a door? When it's ajar.")],
        [Button(7), Speech("What is red and smells like blue paint?  Red paint.")],
    ]

while True:
    for button, speech in buttons_and_speech:
        if button.is_pressed():
            if not speech.is_playing():
                speech.play(duration=None)
    time.sleep(0.01)

 <div class="section" id="challenge">

   <li>

    <p>In the last code example above, there are two nested <code>if</code>
    statements that only allow the speech to start playing if the button is
    pressed and speech is not already playing. Can you combine the two
    <code>if</code> statements into one?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Instead of using all four buttons, use only one. However, modify the
    code so that each time the button is pressed, it plays the <i>next</i> line
    of speech, and when it gets through all four, it starts over again.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The code:</p>
    <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
     <textarea>
from random import randrange
print(randrange(4))
</textarea>
    </div>

    <p>uses the function <code>randrange()</code> to print a random number
    between 0 and 3. Can you modify your code to use <code>randrange()</code>
    to speak a random joke when the button is pressed?</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
