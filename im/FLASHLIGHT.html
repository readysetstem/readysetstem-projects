  <p>In this project, we'll put together the work we did in two of our previous
  projects — getting GPIO input from a button and controlling an LED with a
  GPIO output — to create a "flashlight" circuit that will illuminate an LED
  when the button is pressed. The flashlight will rely on software for both the
  input (reading the button) and the output (lighting the LED).</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>For the hardware in this project, we're going to wire two completely
  independent circuits:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>The first circuit will consist of a button wired to a GPIO (like we did
    in <a data-uid="button"></a>);</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The second circuit will consist of an LED wired to a separate GPIO (like
    we did in <a data-uid="gpoutp"></a>)</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="step">Wire the LED circuit.</h2>

  <p>Let's start by wiring the LED circuit like we did in <a data-uid=
  "gpoutp"></a>: <img class="bb" src=
  "img/Your_First_Breadboard_Add_GPIO_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>We've chosen to wire our LED to GPIO14 — you can use any GPIO you like,
  but if you use a different one, make sure to modify your code
  appropriately.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Wire the button circuit.</h2>

  <p>Next, let's add a button circuit to our breadboard: <img class="bb" src=
  "img/Flashlight_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>In this case, we've chosen GPIO18 for our button — again, you are welcome
  to use any GPIO you like, but if you use a different one, the default code
  below will need to be changed.</p>

  <p>Now that we have our LED and button circuits wired, we can write some code
  to bring those circuits to life...</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">
  <h2 class="step">Write the code.</h2>

  <p>Now that we have the circuits built and ready to go, it's time to write
  our software. For this project, our software is going to do two things:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Read the state of the button (pressed or released) using a GPIO as
    input</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>If the button is pressed, turn on the LED using a GPIO as output, and if
    the button is not pressed, turn off the LED using the GPIO as output</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here is the code that will accomplish this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

if my_button.is_pressed():
    my_led.on()
else:
    my_led.off()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's to through the code line-by-line and take a look at what it's
  doing:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 1, we import the function we will need to initialize the button
    (called <code>Button()</code>)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 2, we import the function we will need to initialize the LED
    (called <code>Output()</code>)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 4, we initialize our button. We call the <code>Button()</code>
    function, which returns a "Button object" to our <code>my_button</code>
    variable. We talked about that a bit in <a data-uid="vars"></a>, but the
    important thing to understand is that we can now use <code>my_button</code>
    to call other GPIO functions that can control our button</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 5, we initialize our LED. We call the <code>Output()</code>
    function, which returns a "GPIO Output object" to our <code>my_led</code>
    variable. Again, we talked about that a bit in <a data-uid="vars"></a>, but
    the important thing to understand is that we can now use
    <code>my_led</code> to call other GPIO functions that can control our
    LED</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 7, we check the state of the button using the
    <code>is_pressed()</code> function. This function will return True if the
    button is pressed (this is done by reading the voltage at the GPIO, like we
    discussed in <a data-uid="button"></a>), and will return False if the
    button is released</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 8, if the return from our if statement is True (the button is
    pressed), we light the LED using the <code>on()</code> function</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 9 and 10, if the return from our if statement is False (the
    button is released), we turn off the LED using the <code>off()</code>
    function</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Notice that with this code, the button status is only read one time when
  the program is run. So, if you want the LED to illuminate, you need to be
  holding the button when you run the code. If you're not holding down the
  button at the time the program is run, the code will see that the button is
  released and the LED will not illuminate.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Improve the code.</h2>

  <p>To make this program more useful, we can put the code that reads the
  button into a loop so that it will continually read the button state and
  update the LED every time it changes. To do this, we simply put the last four
  lines of the code (the lines that test the state of the button and turn the
  LED on or off) in a <code>while True:</code> loop, like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

while True:
    if my_button.is_pressed():
        my_led.on()
    else:
        my_led.off()
    time.sleep(.01)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Give it a try. The flashlight will continue to work until you manually
  stop the program.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Modify the code so that the light turns on with the first press, and off
    with the next press — that is, so you don't have to hold the button down
    for the light to stay on. Hint: you'll probably want a variable that keeps
    track of the state of the button.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you make the light turn on/off with each press, but when it's on,
    only stays on for 3 seconds?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Add a second button. Have the first button turn the light on when
    pressed. Have the second button turn the light off when pressed.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </div>
