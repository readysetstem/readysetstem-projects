  <h1>Functions</h1>

  <p>In this tutorial, we're going to learn about <i>functions</i> and
  <i>modules</i>. A function is one of the most basic concepts in programming
  and also one of the most important. It often takes a lot of code to get a
  computer to do even a simple task, and if you want the computer to do the
  same task over and over again, that could mean having to write lots of the
  same code over and over again.</p>

  <p>That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?</p>

  <p>It's not, which is why, instead of writing the same code many times, we
  have the ability to just write the code once in a special format, and then we
  can use that code over and over again, as many times as we want. The special
  format that allows us to re-use the code over and over again is called a
  function.</p>

  <p>One of the nice things about functions is that they also make it easy for
  you to use code that <i>other</i> people have written, without having to
  retype all the code yourself into your software. In fact, while you may not
  have realized it, you've already used several functions that other people
  have written. Some of those functions are included in the Python programming
  language that everyone (at least everyone who uses Python) has access to. You
  can often recognize functions because they contain <code>()</code> after them
  (many times with information between the parentheses), and when we use a
  function in our code, we generally say we are <i>calling</i> the
  function.</p>

  <p>For example, when you use the command <code>print()</code>, you are
  actually calling a function named "print" that comes standard with the Python
  language. You may think that using <code>print()</code> to print something to
  the screen requires just a single line of code, but what you don't see
  behind-the-scenes is that the <code>print()</code> function actually utilizes
  <i>thousands</i> of lines of code. You read that correctly — every time you
  use <code>print()</code>, Python is running thousands of lines of code to
  print your message to the screen. But, because Python provides this command
  as a function, you can print to the screen using just a single programming
  line.</p>

  <p>In addition to having access to the thousands of functions that are
  provided as part of Python programming language, you also have access to all
  the Ready Set STEM functions — a set of functions that we (the Ready Set STEM
  team) have written to make building with and using the Ready Set STEM CREATOR
  Kit easier and more functional.</p>

  <p>For example, you might see the following in one of our projects:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_led = Output(14)
my_led.on()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Both of the lines of code above are calling Ready Set STEM functions that
  we have written to make using the kit easier and more powerful.
  While you only needed to write two lines of code to setup the GPIO as an
  output and turn on the LED, behind the scenes, there were over 300 lines of
  code that the Ready Set STEM team has written to carry out those tasks. Not
  to mention, within those 300+ lines of code, we were calling functions that
  other people had written — many thousands of more lines of code!</p>

  <p>And again, you were able to utilize all that code by calling a couple
  functions. Even the best programmers in the world rarely write a piece of
  code that doesn't rely on code that others have written. This is one of the
  powerful concepts of programming — in addition to your own code, you get to
  benefit from code that others have written as well.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Why the Dot?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Throughout our projects (and out in the real world), you're going to see
    code that looks like:</p>
    <pre>
my_led.on()
</pre>


    <p>In the above, the period between <code>my_led</code> and
    <code>on()</code> is called the <i>dot operator</i>. The part on the right
    of the dot (in this case <code>on()</code>) is associated with the variable
    on the left (in this case <code>my_led</code>).  You can only use functions
    that are supported by the type of the variable on the left.  In this case,
    when we defined the <code>my_led</code> variable in the line above it, we
    defined it as an <code>Output</code>. By doing that, we gave the
    <code>my_led</code> variable the ability to call several special functions,
    like <code>on()</code> and <code>off()</code>.</p>

    <p>There are many other types of variables you'll use, like numbers, lists,
    strings, <code>Input</code>s and <code>Output</code>s.  Each of those types
    has it's own special functions that they can use, and we'll discuss this more later.

  <h1>Modules</h1>

  <p>In Python, a <i>module</i> is an group of functions (and perhaps
  other things, like variables). Typically, the collection of things in a
  module are all related to one another — perhaps they all are focused on the
  same types of tasks or we're all created by the same person.</p>

  <p>For example, you probably noticed that our Projects Guide is broken up
  into sections, with each section focused on a particular topic and set of
  electronic components. Well, in most cases, we also organize the functions
  needed for each section into their own module. We have a <i><span class=
  "nospell">gpio</span></i> module that contains all of the functions you'll
  use in this section. We have a <i>sound</i> module that contains all of the
  functions you'll use to generate sounds (in the next section and beyond). And
  so on...</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Learning About Available Modules &amp; Functions?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>As you might imagine, different functions are used in different ways.
    Some functions can be run by just using the function name followed by
    <code>()</code> (like the <code>on()</code> function we discussed above).
    Other functions require a bunch of information to be placed between the
    <code>()</code> to tell the function exactly what to do (like putting the
    information we want printed between the <code>()</code> in our
    <code>print()</code> statements.</p>

    <p>But, how do we know what information a function needs/expects and how do
    we know about the special functions available through a dot operator to
    certain functions and variables?</p>

    <p>In most cases, functions will have <i>documentation</i> — that is, a
    place where you can look up all the information about the function. For
    example, if you want to see all the modules that were written and
    provided by the Ready Set STEM team, you can click on the
    <strong>API</strong> icon at the top of this page. <i>API</i> stands for
    "Application Programming Interface" and is a fancy name for functions and
    modules that are used for a specific purpose &mdash; in this case, the Ready Set
    STEM API is used specifically to provide functionality to the 
    CREATOR Kit.</p>

    <p>If you click on the API icon at the top of the RDE, you'll see more
    detailed information on the Ready Set STEM API functions...</p>

  <h1>Importing Functions &amp; Modules</h1>

  <p>Before you can use a function in your code, the computer needs to know
  about it.  Specifically,
  there are the two types of functions you'll encounter:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Built-In Commands:</strong> Some functions can be called
    anytime, anywhere in your code without having to do anything other than
    calling the function. These are referred to as "built-in" functions, and
    the <code>print()</code> function is a good example. We can use the
    <code>print()</code> function anywhere in our code without having to do
    anything other than calling the <code>print()</code> function.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Imported Functions:</strong> For functions that we want to
    use that aren't built-in (including all the Ready Set STEM functions we
    provide), we need to tell the computer about those functions
    before we can use them. We do this by <i>importing</i> the
    function (or the whole module that it's part of) into our code.
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>For functions that need to be imported, there are two ways to do it
  — importing the individual functions we need or importing the entire module
  that holds that function.</p>
  <h2>Importing Individual Functions from a Module</h2>

  <p>In the cases where we only need access to one or two functions
  within a module, it's often convenient to import only the functions we need,
  directly by name. We do this using the <code>from ... import</code> command,
  with the following syntax:</p>
  <pre>
from [module] import [function]
</pre>
  <p>Here's an example of importing the <code>sleep()</code>
function — a function that is used to put our program to sleep for a period of
time:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   
   <textarea>
from time import sleep
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>As you can see, the <code>sleep()</code> function is part of the
  <code>time</code> module, and by importing the way we did above, we can use
  the sleep function simply by calling it (along with the number of seconds
  we want to sleep). Here's an example of what the code might look
  like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   
   <textarea>
from time import sleep
sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The code above isn't very exciting — all it does is wait for 10
  seconds and then the program ends. But, this should give you an idea of how
  functions can be imported and used one at a time.</p>
  <h2>Importing an Entire Module</h2>

  <p>If you're going to be using several functions within the same
  module, it's generally easiest to just import the whole module into your
  code. Doing this gives you access to any of the functions in that module any
  time you need them. We do this using the <code>import</code> command by
  itself.</p>

  <p>As an example, let's give ourselves access to the same
  <code>sleep()</code> function we used again by importing the entire
  <code>time</code> module:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   
   <textarea>
import time
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to <code>sleep()</code>, the module <code>time</code>
  contains functions for telling time, formatting time strings, working with
  time zones, etc. By importing the entire module, we now have access to all
  those functions within that module.</p>

  <p>By importing the entire module, we now have access to the
  <code>sleep()</code> function by calling:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   
   <textarea>
import time
time.sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Notice that to call the <code>sleep()</code> function in this
  example, we had to prepend the function call with the module name and the dot
  operator. This is one of the drawbacks to importing an entire function at a
  time — in order to use any functions within that module, we need to call the
  function using the module name and the dot operator.</p>
