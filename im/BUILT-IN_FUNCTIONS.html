  <h1>Functions</h1>

  <p>In this tutorial, we're going to learn about <i>functions</i> and <i>modules</i>. 
  A function is one of the most basic concepts in programming, and also one of
  the most important. It often takes a lot of code to get a computer to do even
  a simple task. And if you want the computer to do the same task over and over
  again, that could mean having to write lots of the same code over and over again.</p>

  <p>That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?</p>

  <p>It's not, which is why instead of writing the same code many times, we
  have the ability to just write the code once in a special format, and then we
  can use that code over and over again, as many times as we want. The special
  format that allows us to re-use the code over and over again is called a
  function.</p>

  <p>One of the nice things about functions is that it also makes it easy for you
  to use code that <i>other</i> people have written, without having to retype
  all the code yourself into your software.  In fact, while you may not have 
  realized it, you've already used several functions that other people have written. 
  Some of those functions are included in the Python programming language that 
  everyone (at least everyone who uses Python) has access to.  You can often 
  recognize functions because they contain <code>()</code> after them (many times
  with information between the parentheses), and when we use a function in our
  code, we generally say we are <i>calling</i> the function.
  
  <p>For example, when you use the command <code>print()</code>, you are actually 
  calling a function named "print" that comes standard with the Python language. 
  You may think that using <code>print()</code> to print something to the screen 
  requires just a single line of code, but what you don't see behind-the-scenes is 
  that the <code>print()</code> function actually utilizes <i>thousands</i> of lines of
  code. You read that correctly &mdash; every time you use <code>print()</code>,
  Python is running thousands of lines of code to print your message to the screen. 
  But, because Python provides this command as a function, you can print to the screen 
  using just a single programming line.</p>

  <p>In addition to having access to the thousands of functions that are provided 
  as part of Python programming language, you also have access to all the Ready Set 
  STEM functions &mdash; a set of functions that we (the Ready Set STEM team) have written 
  to make building with and using the Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit easier and more
  functional. 
  
  <p>For example, you might see the following in one of our projects:</p>

  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_led = Output(14)
my_led.on()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Both of the lines of code above are calling Ready Set STEM functions that we
  have written to make using the Ready Set STEM easier and more powerful. While
  you only needed to write two lines of code to setup the GPIO as an output and turn 
  on the LED, behind the scenes, there were over 300 lines of code that the
  Ready Set STEM team has written to carry out those tasks. Not to mention, within
  those 300+ lines of code, we were calling functions that other people had
  written &mdash; many thousands more lines of code!</p>

  <p>And again, you were able to utilize all that code by calling a couple functions.
  Even the best programmers in the world rarely write a piece of code that 
  doesn't rely on code that others have written.  This is one of the powerful concepts
  of programming &mdash; in addition to your own code, you get to benefit from
  code that others have written as well.</p>

  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Why the Dot?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Throughout our projects (and out in the real world), you're going to see code that looks like:
    <pre>
my_led.on()
</pre>
    <p>In the above, the period between <code>my_led</code> and <code>on()</code> is called the 
	<i>dot operator</i>.  It tells that part of the computer that executes the code that what follows
	it (in this case <code>on()</code>) is a special function that only works on variables of that type.
	In this case, when we defined the <code>my_led</code> variable in the line above it, we did it by 
	calling another function <code>Output()</code>.  By doing that, we gave the <code>my_led</code>
	variable the ability to call several special functions, like <code>on()</code> and <code>off()</code>.
	
	<p>The Ready Set STEM team wrote the <code>on()</code> and <code>off()</code> functions specifically
	to be used any time we have a variable defined using the <code>Output()</code> function.  We'll have
	more to say about this below, including information about how to get more information about the 
	functions available for you to use.

  <h1>Modules</h1>
  
  <p>In Python, a <i>module</i> is an organization of functions (and perhaps other things, like variables).
  Typically, the collection of things in a module are all related to one another &mdash; perhaps they 
  all are focused on the same types of tasks or all come from the same person.  
  
  <p>For example, you probably noticed that our Projects Guide is broken up into sections, with each 
  section focused on a particular topic and set of electronic components.  Well, in most cases, we also
  organize the functions needed for each section into their own module.  We have a <i><span
  class=nospell>gpio</span></i>
  module that contains all of the functions you'll use in this section.  We have a <i>sound</i>
  module that contains all of the functions you'll use to generate sounds (in the next section and beyond).
  And so on...

   <div>	

  <p>As you might imagine, different functions are used in different ways.  Some functions can be run
  by just using the function name followed by <code>()</code> (like the <code>on()</code> function we 
  discussed above).  Other functions require a bunch of information to be placed between the <code>()</code>
  to tell the function exactly what to do (like putting the information we want printed between the 
  <code>()</code> in our <code>print()</code> statements.
  
  <p>But, how do we know what information a function needs/expects and how do we know about the special
  functions available through a dot operator to certain functions and variables?
  
  <p>In most cases, functions will have <i>documentation</i> &mdash; that is, a place where you can
  look up all the information about the function.  For example, if you want to see all the modules and that
  were written and provided by the Ready Set STEM team, you can click on the <strong>API</strong> icon
  at the top of this page.  <i>API</i> stands for "Application Programming Interface" and is a fancy name
  for functions and modules that are used for a specific purpose -- in this case, the Ready Set STEM API
  is used specifically to provide functionality to the the Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit.

  <h1>Importing Functions & Modules</h1>

  <p>Depending on the specific function(s) you want to use, you may or may 
  not have to let your software know about it beforehand.  Specifically, there
  are the two type of functions you'll encounter:
  
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p><strong>Built-In Commands:</strong> Some functions can be called
    anytime, anywhere in your code without having to do anything other than
    calling the function. These are referred to as "built-in" functions, and
    the <code>print()</code> function is a good example. We can use the
    <code>print()</code> function anywhere in our code without having to do
    anything other than calling the <code>print()</code> function.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Imported Functions:</strong> For functions that we want to use 
	that aren't built-in (including all the Ready Set STEM functions we provide),
    we need to tell the computer that we are going to want access to the
    function(s) before we can use them. We do this by <i>importing</i> the function
    (or the whole module that it's part of) into our code before we can call those 
	functions. Only after the function has been imported into our code can
	we use that function.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>For functions that need to be imported, there are two ways to do it &mdash;
  importing the individual functions we need or importing the entire module that 
  holds that function.
  
  <h2>Importing Individual Functions From a Module</h2>

  <p>In the cases where we only need access to one or two functions within a module
  it's often convenient to import only the functions we need, directly by name. 
  We do this using the <code>from ... import</code> command, with the following syntax:
  
  <pre>
  from [module] import [function]
  </pre>
  
  Here's an example of importing the <code>sleep()</code> function &mdash; a function 
  that is used to put our program to sleep for a period of time:

  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from time import sleep
</textarea>
  </div>
  
  <p>As you can see, the <code>sleep()</code> function is part of the <code>time</code> 
  module, and by importing the way we did above, we can use the sleep function in 
  simply by calling it (along with the number of seconds we want to sleep).  Here's 
  an example of what the code might look like:
  
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from time import sleep
sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>
  
  <p>The code above isn't very exciting &mdash; all it does is wait for 10 seconds and
  then the program ends.  But, this should give you an idea of how functions can be
  imported and used one at a time.
  
  <h2>Importing an Entire Module</h2>

  <p>If you're going to be using several functions within the same module, it's
  generally easiest to just import the whole module into your code. Doing this gives
  you access to any of the functions in that module any time you need them. We
  do this using the <code>import</code> command by itself.  
  
  <p>As an example, let's give
  ourselves access to the same <code>sleep()</code> function we used again by importing
  the entire <code>time</code> module:
  
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
import time
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to <code>sleep()</code>, the module <code>time</code> contains functions 
  for telling time, formatting time strings, working with time zones, etc. By importing the 
  entire module, we now have access to all those functions within that module.</p>

  <p>By importing the entire module, we now have access to the <code>sleep()</code> function 
  by calling:</p>

  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
import time
time.sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Notice that to call the <code>sleep()</code> function in this example, we had to prepend 
  the function call with the module name and the dot operator.  This is one of the drawbacks
  to importing an entire function at a time &mdash; in order to use any functions within
  that module, we need to call the function using the module name and the dot operator.
