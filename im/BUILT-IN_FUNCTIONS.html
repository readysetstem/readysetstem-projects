  <h1>Using Functions</h1>

  <p>In this project we're going to learn about functions and modules. A
  function is one of the most basic concepts in programming, and also one of
  the most important. It often takes a lot of code to get a computer to do even
  a simple task. And if you want the computer to do a simple task over and over
  again, that could mean having to write lots of code over and over again.</p>

  <p>That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?</p>

  <p>It's not, which is why instead of writing the same code many times, we
  have the ability to just write the code once in a special format, and then we
  can use that code over and over again, as many times as we want. The special
  format that allows us to re-use the code over and over again is called a
  function.</p>

  <p>While you may not have realized it, you've already used several functions
  that other people have written. Some of those functions are included in the
  Python programming language that everyone (at least everyone who uses Python)
  has access to. For example, when you use the command <code>print()</code>,
  you are actually calling a function named "print" that comes standard with
  the Python language. You may think that <code>print()</code> requires just a
  single line of code, but what you don't see behind-the-scenes is that the
  <code>print()</code> function utilizes <i>thousands</i> of lines of
  code. You read that correctly &mdash; every time you use <code>print()</code>,
  Python is running thousands of lines of code. But, because Python provides
  this command as a function, you can print output using a single programming
  line.</p>

  <p>Now, in addition to thousands of functions that are provided as part of
  Python programming language, you also have access to the Ready Set STEM API &mdash;
  a set of functions that we (the Ready Set STEM team) have written to make
  building with and using the Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit easier and more
  functional. For example, you might see the following in one of our
  projects:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_led = Output(14)
my_led.on()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Both of those lines of code are calling Ready Set STEM functions that we
  have written to make using the Ready Set STEM easier and more powerful. While
  you only needed to write two lines of code to setup the GPIO and turn on the
  LED, behind the scenes, there were over 300 lines of code that the
  Ready Set STEM team has written to handle those tasks. Not to mention, within
  those 300+ lines of code, we were calling functions that other people had
  written that accounted for many thousands more lines of code!</p>

  <p>And again, you were able to utilize all that code by writing just a single
  line.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Why the dot?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Throughout the projects, you'll see code that looks like:
    <pre>
my_led.on()
</pre>
    <p>In the above, the period is called the <i>dot operator</i>.  It says that the next function (in
    this case <code>on()</code>) is a function <i>of</i> the variable <code>my_led</code>.  It is
    a special function that can use <code>my_led</code>.

  <h1>Other People's Code</h1>

  <p>There are two ways you can use that other people have written:

  <ul>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Built-In Commands:</strong> Some functions can be called
    anytime, anywhere in your code without having to do anything other than
    calling the function. These are referred to as "built-in" functions, and
    the <code>print()</code> function is a good example. We can use the
    <code>print()</code> function anywhere in our code without having to do
    anything other than calling the <code>print()</code> function.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Importing Functions/Modules:</strong> For non-built-in functions
    that we want to use (including all the Ready Set STEM functions we provide),
    we need to tell the computer that we are going to want access to the
    function(s) before we can use them. We do this by "importing" the function
    or the whole module into our code before we can call those functions. There
    are two common ways of importing functions into your code, which we discuss
    below.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Importing an Entire Module</h2>

  <p>If you're going to be using several functions within the same module, it's
  generally easiest to just import a module into your code. Doing this gives
  you access to any of the functions in that module any time you need them. We
  do this using the "import" command, and a good example that you've probably
  already seen is:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
import time
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The module "time" contains functions for telling time, formatting time
  strings, working with time zones, etc. One function from the time module that
  we frequently use in our projects is <code>sleep()</code>. By importing that
  module, we now have access to all the functions within that module.</p>

  <p>We now have access to the <code>sleep()</code> function by calling:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="2">
   <textarea>
time.sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The function call above would sleep (pause) for 10 seconds.</p>
  <h2>Importing Individual Functions From a Module</h2>

  <p>In some cases, we don't need access to all the functions within a module
  &mdash; we only need access to one or two. It's often convenient to import only
  the functions we need, directly by name. When we import in this way, we can
  directly use the function without prefacing it with the module name. For
  example, here is equivalent code to sleep for 10 seconds:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from time import sleep
sleep(10)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Throughout the projects, we'll be using a lot of functions. We'll make
  sure to point them out as we're using them, and hopefully you can begin to
  get an idea of how powerful functions and modules can be when writing complex
  code.</p>
