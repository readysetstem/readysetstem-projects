  <h1>Where's Steve?</h1>

  <p>Minecraft has a number of APIs geared towards managing the position of
  your character and the blocks within the game. Location within the Minecraft
  world is typically defined using an X, Y, Z coordinate system. There are
  important points to note with this...</p>

  <p>First, the coordinate system is oriented as follows:</p>
  <img style="width: 70%" alt="" src= "img/minecraft_coord.jpg">

  <p>And second, the point (0, 0, 0) will correspond approximately to the
  center of the Minecraft world, as follows:</p>
  <img style="width: 70%" alt="" src= "img/minecraft_center.jpg">

  <p>This means that the X axis will be used to denote north/south, with
  positive X values denoting north of the center of the world and negative X
  values denoting south of the center of the world. Likewise, the Z axis will
  denote east/west, with +Z indicating east and -Z indicating west. The Y axis
  denotes distance from ground-level &mdash; +Y is above ground and -Y is below
  ground.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Vectors</h1>
  <p>Vectors define a position in the Minecraft world.  They are nothing more
  than the three X, Y, and Z coordinates used to define a position.  Because
  some of the API functions return vectors, it's handy to know how to use
  them.  And, we can add vectors together, which is quite convenient!

  <p>For example, in the <a data-uid="shovel1"></a> project, we used the 
  <code>pollBlockHits()</code> function, which returned a list of hits.  We 
  discussed how <code>hit.pos</code> contained the X, Y, and Z coordinates.  
  Now we understand why &mdash; <code>hit.pos</code> is a vector!  

  <p>Here's an example of how we can use vectors...  
  
  <p>Let's say that instead of printing the block that you hit (which is at 
  location <code>hit.pos</code>), you instead wanted to print the location 
  of the block directly above it.  With vectors, this is easy &mdash;
  simply add another vector (0,1,0) to it.  That will increase the Y value by
  1, which will be one above the block that you hit.  
  
  <p>Here's how you could do it (modifying the code from the 
  <a data-uid="shovel1"></a> project) &mdash; instead of printing this:

  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print("The X, Y, Z coordinates of the block you hit is:", hit.pos)
</textarea>
  </div>

<p>we can use the following to print the block directly above it:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print("The X, Y, Z coordinates of the block you hit is:", hit.pos + Vec3(0,1,0))
</textarea>

  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Teleport</h1>
  <p>In general, there are two main things we'll want to do with Steve's position &mdash;
  find out what his position is and change it.  Changing it takes effect immediately, so
  when you change his position, he teleports to the new location!

  <h2><code>player.getPos()</code> and <code>player.getTilePos()</code></h2>

  <p>The <code>player.getPos()</code> function returns the Steve's location as a vector:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
print(mc.player.getPos())
</textarea>
  </div>
<p>The only difference between the two functions is that
  <code>player.getPos()</code> returns the <i>exact</i> position of Steve whereas
  <code>player.getTilePos()</code> returns the position of the center of the
  tile that Steve is standing on.  These two functions return coordinates that
  are pretty close to each other.

  <h2><code>player.setPos()</code> and <code>player.setTilePos()</code></h2>
  <p>The <code>player.setPos()</code> function sets Steve's location:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft
from rstem.mcpi.vec3 import Vec3
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()
mc.player.setPos(0,0,0)
mc.player.setPos(Vec3(0,0,0))
</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>In the above, you'll see two ways you can call the function, and both have the same effect:
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>
    On Line 4, we've directly called the function with the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
    On Line 5, we've called the function a vector that contains the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
   </p> </li>
  </ul>
    
   <p>Just like previous functions, the only difference between these two
   functions 
  (<code>player.getPos()</code> and
  <code>player.getTilePos()</code>)
   is that they set either the <i>exact</i> position, or the
   <i>tile</i> position.
