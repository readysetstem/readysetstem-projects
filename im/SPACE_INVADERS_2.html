  <p>In this project, we continue the development of our Alien Intruders game
  by initializing and drawing our ship at the correct location.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was
  completed for the <a data-uid="ai1"></a> project. Here's a reminder:
  <img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_Accel_Buttons_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>Now that we have the framebuffer initialized and have verified that the
  LED Matrix is working, let's put our spaceship where it's supposed to be
  located — in the middle of the LED Matrix horizontally, and in the bottom
  row.</p>

  <p>To determine the middle of the LED Matrix, we could take the known width
  (8 dots) and divide that by two — that would give us our middle dot (x=4).
  But, what if you later want to use this code on a smaller or larger LED
  Matrix display? For example, let's say you put four LED Matrices together to
  build a 16x16 display. If you put x=4 right into your code, when you run the
  program on your new 16x16 display, your spaceship will no longer be in the
  middle of the display.</p>

  <p>Luckily, we have a way to handle this. If you remember back to our
  <code>FrameBuffer</code> concept, we have an attribute called
  <code>fb.width</code> that will determine how many LED Matrices you have
  chained together and will tell you the total width of your LED Matrix
  display. We can use that attribute to determine the actual width of the
  display, and then divide that actual width by 2 to get the starting position
  of our spaceship.</p>

  <p>Here is what the initialization code for the initial position of the ship
  would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Initialize the spaceship
spaceship_position = fb.width / 2
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In our previous project, we just drew the ship at (3,0). But, now we have
  the actual x-coordinate from our calculation above, so we can draw the ship
  at its actual starting position.</p>

  <p>But, there's one thing we need to keep in mind — now that we're using a
  calculation to determine the position of the ship, it's possible that the
  result of our calculation won't be a whole number (for example, if we were
  using an LED Matrix that was 7 dots wide, our initial position would be
  x=3.5). To accommodate for that, we need to round our calculation to the
  nearest whole number, and that is where we will display our ship.</p>

  <p>We do that using the built-in math function called <code>round()</code>,
  which will round the value we give it to the nearest whole number.</p>

  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point
  (with new changes highlighted with arrows):</p>
