  <p>In the previous project, we were creating an accelerometer game that
  recorded each time the CREATOR Kit is tapped. The result of the program was a
  list of times that the user tapped on the CREATOR Kit.</p>

  <p>In this project, we'll make this a bit more useful — we'll create a secret
  knock. In this case the user will have to tap on the kit with a very specific
  rhythm. If the their rhythm is reasonably close to our "secret" rhythm,
  then they've corrected entered the secret knock.</p>

  <p>A secret knock could be used to gain access to a room, to start another
  program, to send a message over the network, or in many other ways!</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>You'll need to wire up only the accelerometer and speaker as done in previous
  projects. Here is what your breadboard should look like:</p>

  <p>The new additions we've made highlighted above are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 48 through 58, we print out the rhythm (with stars ('*')). To
    do this, we first eliminate a two special cases: if there's no taps or if
    there's just one tap, we just let the user know. When there are two or more
    taps, for each tap, we print the relative amount of spaces from the
    previous tap, followed by a star.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 61 and 62, we define a secret knock that the user must
    reproduce.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 65 through 70, we test to see if the user's taps match our
    <code>secret_knock</code>. To match, the two lists must be the same length,
    and each user tap time must be close to the secret knock time.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 72 through 75, we simply print out whether or not the user
    correctly entered the secret knock.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The secret knock in the code above is 2 quick knocks followed by 2 slightly
  slower knocks:  <strong>KNOCK&nbsp;KNOCK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOCK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOCK</strong>.
  <p>If your timing is off, take a look at the numbers that print out in the Output
  Window (the first set is your knocks and the second set is the secret knock) and
  then try adjusting until you get the pattern.  It might take a couple tries...
