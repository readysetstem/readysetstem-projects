<H1>CALCULATIONS</H1>
<P>While understanding
how strings work is an important concept, you’re likely going to
find that most of your programming work involves numbers and
calculations.  And this is a good thing, given that computers are
great at doing arithmetic and other basic math.</P>
<P>In the previous
Project, when we wrote the code:</P>
<P>print
(‘1+1’)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>you saw that the
output was:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_70568b2c.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=612 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0></P>
<P>But, what if we
didn’t want the program to output the string, but instead wanted
the program to calculate the ‘1+1’ and output the result?  This
is accomplished by simply leaving off the quotation marks in our
code, like this:</P>
<P>print
(1+1)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If you were to enter
this code into your code window and run the program, your output
would look like this, exactly what you’d be looking for:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_70568b2c.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=612 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0></P>
<P>
<BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Programming Operators</H2>
<P>The most common math
calculations you’ll do while programming will be addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division.  You’ve already seen that
when doing addition in your code, you use the + sign, just like in
the real world.  And subtraction will use the – sign as well.  But,
when writing code, we use different operator signs for multiply and
divide.</P>
<P>Here is a quick
reference of the basic operator signs you will need to know:</P>
<CENTER>
	<TABLE WIDTH=339 BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR="#00000a" CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0>
		<COL WIDTH=223>
		<COL WIDTH=82>
		<TR VALIGN=TOP>
			<TD WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=17 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P>Addition</P>
			</TD>
			<TD WIDTH=82 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P ALIGN=CENTER>+</P>
			</TD>
		</TR>
		<TR VALIGN=TOP>
			<TD WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=18 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P>Subtraction</P>
			</TD>
			<TD WIDTH=82 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P ALIGN=CENTER>-</P>
			</TD>
		</TR>
		<TR VALIGN=TOP>
			<TD WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=18 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P>Multiplication</P>
			</TD>
			<TD WIDTH=82 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P ALIGN=CENTER>*</P>
			</TD>
		</TR>
		<TR VALIGN=TOP>
			<TD WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=17 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P>Division</P>
			</TD>
			<TD WIDTH=82 BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
				<P ALIGN=CENTER>/</P>
			</TD>
		</TR>
	</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Let’s practice
using these operators.  In your code window, enter the following
lines:</P>
<P>print
(1 + 1)</P>
<P>print
(5 – 2)</P>
<P>print
(2 * 2)</P>
<P>print
(10 / 2)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If you run this
code, you should expect the following output:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_70568b2c.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=612 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Of course, computers
can do more complicated calculations as well.  For example, let’s
say we wanted to calculate the number of seconds in a day?  How would
we do this?</P>
<H2>Number of Seconds in a Day</H2>
<P>To calculate the
number of seconds in a day, the easiest way would be to multiply:</P>
<P><B>(# seconds in a
minute) x (# minutes in an hour) x (# hours in a day) </B>
</P>
<P>We know that there
are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>60 seconds in a minute</P>
	<LI><P>60 minutes in an hour</P>
	<LI><P>24 hours in a day</P>
</UL>
<P>If we multiple each
of those numbers, we should get the number of seconds in a day.  Here
is what the code would look like:</P>
<P>print
(60 * 60 * 24)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Go ahead and enter
that code into your Code Window and run the program.  Here is what
your output should look like:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_70568b2c.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=612 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0></P>
<P>There are 86,400
seconds in a day.</P>
<H2>Order of Operations</H2>
<P>…</P>
<H2>Combining Strings &amp; Calculations</H2>
<P>…</P>
<P>print
(‘Number of seconds in a day is: ’, 60 * 60 * 24)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
