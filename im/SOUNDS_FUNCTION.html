  <h1>Sounds Galore</h1>

  <p>Most games and gadgets use prerecorded sounds and songs to make the devices
  more useful and fun. The Ready Set STEM API provides some simple functions to
  play recorded sounds that are on the SD card.</p>

  <p>The main function you'll use to play sounds is:</p>
  <pre>
Sound(<i>sound_filename</i>)
</pre>

  <p>where <code><i>sound_filename</i></code> is the name of the file on the SD
  card that you want to play.</p>

  <p>For example, to hear a cat meow, you can try this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import Sound
meow = Sound('Meow.wav')
meow.play()
meow.wait()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The sound file <span class=nospell>"Meow.wav"</span> lives on the SD-Card in the default sound
  directory, along with all the sounds on the SD card. If you'd like to find
  out where this directory is located, you can write a little program to do
  that, using the function <code>sound_dir</code>:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import sound_dir
print(sound_dir())
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>And, from there you could go to the desktop and view that directory from
  the File Manager. Or, you can do it using some code as well! Python provides
  a function that will return a list of all the files in a directory, called
  <code>listdir()</code>:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.sound import sound_dir
from os import listdir
print(listdir(sound_dir()))
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you run that program, you'll see a list of all the sounds you can
  play.</p>

  <p>In addition, you can add your own sounds to the SD card. If your Raspberry
  Pi is on the network, you can download sound files from the web right onto
  the SD card. You can even copy them directly to the SD card. We won't go into
  to the details of downloading or copying here (you can find more info online),
  but once you have a sound downloaded, you can play it simply by specifying
  its full location when creating the sound.</p>

  <p>For example, if you had downloaded a sound file called
  <span class=nospell>"MyVeryOwnCoolSound.wav"</span> and stored it in the <i>/home/pi</i> directory, you
  could do the following:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
mysound = Sound('/home/pi/MyVeryOwnVeryCoolSound.wav')
</textarea>
  </div>One final thing to mention: a <code>Sound</code> is very similar to a
  <code>Note</code> in that you can call the same functions to
  <code>play()</code> them, <code>wait()</code> for them, or
  <code>stop()</code> them.
