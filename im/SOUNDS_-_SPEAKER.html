  <h1>How speakers work</h1><img style="width: 500px;" alt="" src=
  "img/speaker1.jpg">

  <p>Speakers make sounds. They exist all around us in or lives &mdash; in phones,
  TVs, greeting cards, toys, musical keyboards, and video games. They allow us
  to directly play amplified sounds through electric megaphones, PA (public
  announcement) systems in schools and buildings, and loudspeakers at concerts.
  They can also play recorded sounds, or even create new made up sounds that
  you'd never hear in nature.</p>

  <p>Speakers work by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. That
  is, changes in the the voltage/current in a circuit can cause something
  physical to move back and forth. As we talked about in <a data-uid=
  "sources"></a>, electricity and magnetism are two closely related concepts.
  In an electric motor, current flowing through a loop of wire will push on a
  nearby magnet. This pushing force is felt equally by both the magnet and the
  loop of wire, and causes them to move apart. A speaker uses this property to
  move and vibrate the cone the speaker (the frontmost part that you see),
  which in turn vibrates the surrounding air.</p>

  <p><mark>PIC: Animated speaker circuit, with sounds waves to an
  ear.</mark></p>
  <h1>Sound waves</h1>

  <p>As the speaker vibrates, the air around it vibrates as well, and
  travels outward from the speaker in all directions. When the vibrations
  travel into your ear, you are able to sense the vibrations as
  sounds.</p>

  <p>The vibrations that create sounds move back and forth a different
  speeds (frequencies). The faster the vibrations move, the higher the
  frequency, or pitch, that you hear. Likewise, slower vibrations make lower
  frequency sounds. Because larger, more massive objects tend to move slower,
  they also tend to make lower frequency sounds. And, smaller, lighter objects
  tend to make higher frequency sounds.</p>

  <p><mark>PIC: low freq vs high freq animation. Maybe.</mark></p>

  <p>For example, if you take a glass partially filled with water, and
  gently tap it with a spoon, the glass will ring. If you add more water, and
  tap it again, the glass will ring at a <i>lower</i> frequency. The more water
  you add, the more massive the glass and water become, and therefore the
  slower it can vibrate. Slower vibrations mean lower frequencies.</p>

  <p>Sounds and music are composed of a continuous blend of many
  different frequency that you hear at the same time. It is the combination of
  sound waves vibrating at different frequencies that create all of the
  familiar (and distinct) sounds you know, from trumpets and violins, to chalk
  scratching a blackboard.</p>

  <p>The CREATOR Kit includes a small speaker, which means its better for
  higher frequency sounds than low frequency sounds. Also, the CREATOR Kit's
  speaker is unamplified &mdash; this means that the sounds it produces will be at a
  relatively low volume.</p>
