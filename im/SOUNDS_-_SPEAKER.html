  <h1>Speaker Basics</h1><img style="width: 500px;" alt="" src=
  "img/speaker1.jpg">

  <p>The purpose of a speaker is simple — to make sounds. Speakers exist all
  around us — in phones, TVs, radios, greeting cards, toys, musical keyboards,
  and video games. Some speakers are <i>amplified</i> — they take sounds and use
  special components to make the sounds louder. For example, electric
  megaphones, PA (public announcement) systems in schools and buildings, and
  loudspeakers at concerts. These speakers can also play recorded sounds, or even create
  new made up sounds that you'd never hear in nature.</p>

  <p>Speakers work by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. That
  is, changes in the voltage/current in a circuit cause something physical to
  move back and forth, which generates a sound. As we talked about in <a data-uid=
  "sources"></a>, electricity and magnetism are two closely related concepts.
  In an electric motor, current flowing through a loop of wire will push on a
  nearby magnet. This pushing force is felt equally by both the magnet and the
  loop of wire, and causes them to move apart. A speaker uses this property to
  move and vibrate the cone of the speaker (the frontmost part that you see),
  which in turn vibrates the surrounding air.</p>

  <h1>Sound Waves</h1>

  <p>As the speaker vibrates, the air around it vibrates as well, and travels
  outward from the speaker in all directions. When the vibrations travel into
  your ear, you are able to sense the vibrations as sounds.</p>

  <p>The vibrations that create sounds move back and forth at different speeds
  (frequencies). The faster the vibrations move, the higher the frequency, or
  pitch, that you hear. Likewise, slower vibrations make lower frequency
  sounds. Because larger, more massive objects tend to move slower, they also
  tend to make lower frequency sounds. And, smaller, lighter objects tend to
  make higher frequency sounds.</p>

  <!-- PIC: PIC: low freq vs high freq animation.  -->

  <p>For example, if you take a glass partially filled with water, and gently
  tap it with a spoon, the glass will ring. If you add more water, and tap it
  again, the glass will ring at a <i>lower</i> frequency. The more water you
  add, the more massive the glass and water become, and therefore the slower it
  can vibrate. Slower vibrations mean lower frequencies.</p>

  <p>Sounds and music are composed of a continuous blend of many different
  frequencies that you hear at the same time. It is the combination of sound
  waves vibrating at different frequencies that create all of the familiar (and
  distinct) sounds you know, from trumpets and violins, to chalk scratching a
  blackboard.</p>

  <p>The CREATOR Kit includes a small speaker; small speakers tend to be better for
  higher frequency sounds than lower frequency sounds. Also, the CREATOR Kit's
  speaker is unamplified — this means that the sounds it produces will be at a
  relatively low volume.  If you are using the kit in a noisy environment, we
  recommend using earphones or computer speakers plugged into the audio jack
  instead.</p>
