 <p>In this project, we'll expand on our previous project where we integrated
 the LED Matrix to indicate our position in the Minecraft world. In the
 previous project, we scaled our position in the Minecraft world to a position
 on the LED Matrix, but when our scaled position was outside the LED Matrix
 boundary of 0 to 7, we forced it to either 0 or 7 and displayed it at that
 location.</p>

 <p>In this project, when we determine that our character is outside the bounds
 of the LED Matrix, instead of just displaying the location as the edge of the
 LED Matrix, we'll display the location at the edge and flash the LED. This
 will indicate that we're outside of the scaled world.</p>

 <p>The main differnce between the code in the last project and the code in
 this project is that, for this project, we'll add an extra test to determine
 if the location of our character is outside the boundaries of the LED Matrix,
 and if so, we'll flash the LED for as long as that condition continues to be
 true.</p>
 <h2>Full Code</h2>

 <p>Here is what the full code for this project should look like. We'll dig
 further into the highlighted pieces of code below:</p>
 <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
  <textarea>
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control
import time

control.show()

fb = FrameBuffer()

SCALE = 25
count = 0
FLASH_COUNT = 3
flash_lit = True

def scale_to_led(pos, scale):
    led_pos = round(pos/scale + .5*(fb_width - 1))
    if not 0 &lt;= led_pos &lt;= 7:
        flash_on = True
    else:
        flash_on = False
    led_pos = min(7, max(0, led_pos))
    return led_pos, flash_on

while True:
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

    flashing = False

    x, flash_x = scale_to_led(pos.x, SCALE)
    z, flash_z = scale_to_led(pos.x, SCALE)
    if flash_x == True or flash_z == True:
        flashing = True

    fb.erase()
    count += 1
    if count &gt; FLASH_COUNT:
        flash_lit = not flash_lit
        count = 0
    if not flashing or flashing and flash_lit:
        fb.point(z, x)
    fb.show()

    time.sleep(0.01)

 </div>
 <h2><code>scale_to_led()</code> Function</h2>

 <p>Like the function we wrote in the previous project, this function will
 first scale the position in the Minecraft world and map it to a whole number
 value. In the previous project, we ensured that value was between 0 and 7, but
 in this project, we want to take appropriate action (flash the LED) if it
 falls outside of that value.</p>

 <p>For that reason, after generating the whole number value, our function will
 check to see if the value is between 0 and 7, and if it falls outside that
 range, we'll set our <code>flash_on</code> variable to True, indicating that
 we are outside the range and should be flashing the LED. After that, we'll
 continue to convert our range to between 0 and 7, and then we'll return both
 the position value and the value of our <code>flash_on</code> variable.</p>
 <h2>Flashing the LED</h2>

 <p>In our main game loop, after getting our position and setting the default
 <code>flashing</code> variable value to False, we pass both the X and Z
 location values to our function. For each, our function returns the LED value
 for that axis and an indication of whether the LED should be flashing for that
 axis. If either axis should result in the LED flashing, we set our
 <code>flashing</code> variable to True before we continue to our drawing
 code.</p>

 <p>Our drawing code first checks to see if our LED has been lit (or not lit)
 for longer than our pre-defined flash duration, and if so, toggles the
 appropriate LED state and resets the count. Finally, we check to see if the
 LED should be lit, and if so, we plot that point on the LED Matrix.</p>
