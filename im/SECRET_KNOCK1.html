  <p>In this project, we start building an accelerometer application that will 
  record each time the CREATOR Kit is tapped.  As you'll see in future projects,
  this will open the door for some interesting games and devices.  
  
  <p>In previously projects, we've mostly been using the
  accelerometer to measure tilt &mdash; which is one function of the accelerometer.
  But, what the accelerometer <i>really</i> does is measure forces in 3 directions. 
  When you knock on the top of the lid of the CREATOR Kit, the accelerometer <i>feels</i> 
  the force of your knock by sensing the up/down movement and vibration of the kit 
  resulting from the knock.  In fact, because it's so sensitive, even a relatively 
  gentle knock will provide enough force to be measured by the accelerometer.</p>

 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>For this and the following projects, we'll only need the accelerometer wired
  up and the speaker attached.  Here is what your breadboard should look like:</p>
  <img class="bb" src="img/Accel_bb.jpg" alt=
  "">
 </div>
 
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>To register a knock with the accelerometer, the force we'll be trying to measure 
  is an up and down motion &mdash; that is, a change in the Z axis force. In this first 
  project, we'll start simple and record this force to see when it goes over some threshold
  that we define.</p>  
  
  <p>When the accelerometer sits in the breadboard, even though it may look like
  it is sitting perfectly flat, it is likely that it is off by a few degrees.
  So, before we can do a good job of measuring the up-and-down force on the Z axis,
  we'll need to calibrate the sensor. Calibrating the sensor means to figure out
  how far off from flat the sensor is really sitting, so that we'll be able to
  adjust our calculations later given this information.</p>

  <p>Here is our first set of code that calibrates the sensor, and then records
  a few seconds of user taps.</p>

  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
from rstem.sound import Note
import time

accel = Accel()

# Calibrate
z_rest = 0
SAMPLES = 100
for i in range(SAMPLES):
    x, y, z = accel.forces()
    z_rest += z
    time.sleep(0.01)
z_rest /= SAMPLES

# Beep to tell user we're starting recording
beep = Note('A6')
beep.play(0.2).wait()

# Record taps
TOTAL_TICKS = 2000
raw_tap_ticks = []
for i in range(TOTAL_TICKS):
    x, y, z = accel.forces()
    if abs(z_rest-z) &gt; 0.1:
        raw_tap_ticks.append(i)
    time.sleep(0.001)

# Beep to tell user we've stopped recording
beep.play(0.2).wait()

print(raw_tap_ticks)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing in more detail:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 8 through 14, we calibrate the sensor. In a <code>for</code>
    loop, we sum the Z force on the accelerometer that we read
    <code>SAMPLES</code> times. After the <code>for</code> loop, we divide the
    sum by the number of <code>SAMPLES</code>. This gives us the average value
    of the Z force when the kit is just sitting flat on the table.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 17 and 18, we play a start beep so the user knows we've started
    recording.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 21 through 27, we record the user's taps. In a <code>for</code>
    loop, we test each tap to see if the force is greater than some threshold
    (0.1). If it is, we record the tap by appending it to the list
    <code>raw_tap_ticks</code>. Note: when we check to to see if the force is
    above a threshold, we subtract <code>z_rest</code> from our test, which
    makes sure that our test is calibrated.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 30, we play an end beep so the user knows we've stopped
    recording.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 32, we print out the "taps" that we've recorded.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Give it a try. After the start beep, gently tap a short rhythm on the
  CREATOR Kit lid (don't tap the accelerometer directly &mdash; we don't want
  to break it!). Stop tapping after the second beep.
  
  <p>One you're done tapping, the output will show you the number of times that 
  the taps occurred. The numbers that are printed are the time through the 
  <code>for</code> loop that the tap occurred. For each tap, you might see a 
  bunch of numbers close
  together in value. The reason is that when the tap occurs, the Z force will
  go wildly up and down for a few moments as the kit vibrates.</p>
  
  <p>We'll fix that in the next project...
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>What happens if you hold the kit off of the table while it is being
    calibrated? Why?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The taps were recorded for about 2 seconds. Can you double the length of
    time that taps get recorded?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The Z force threshold was arbitrarily chosen to be 0.1. Can you change
    this threshold to be more or less sensitive to taps? If the threshold is
    too low, then you'll record taps even when no one tapped. What is the
    smallest threshold you can use that doesn't record any taps if no one
    taps?</p>
