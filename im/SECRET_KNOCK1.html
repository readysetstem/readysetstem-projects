  <p>In this project, we start creating an accelerometer game that can record
  each time the CREATOR Kit is tapped. To do this, we'll use just the
  accelerometer. In previously projects, we've mostly been using the
  accelerometer to measure tilt — but what the accelerometer <i>really</i> does
  is measure forces in 3 directions. When you knock on the top of the lid of
  the CREATOR Kit, the accelerometer on the breadboard will <i>feel</i> the
  force of your knock, and vibrate up and down. A relatively gentle knock will
  provide enough force to be measured by the accelerometer.</p>

  <p>The force we'll be trying to measure is an up and down motion — that is, a
  change in the z-axis force. In this first project, we'll start simple and
  record this force to see when it goes over some threshold..</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>You'll need to wire up only the Accelerometer as done in previous
  projects. Here is what your breadboard should look like:</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src="img/Accel_bb.jpg" alt=
  ""></div>
 </div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>When the accelerometer sits in the breadboard, even though it may look like
  it is sitting perfectly flat, it is likely that it is off by a few degrees.
  So, before we do a good job of measuring the up-and-down force on the z-axis,
  we'll need to calibrate the sensor. Calibrating the sensor means to figure out
  how far off from flat the sensor is really sitting — we'll then be able to
  adjust our calculations later given this information.</p>

  <p>Here is our first set of code that calibrates the sensor, and then records
  a few seconds of user taps.</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
from rstem.sound import Note
import time

accel = Accel()

# Calibrate
z_rest = 0
SAMPLES = 100
for i in range(SAMPLES):
    x, y, z = accel.forces()
    z_rest += z
    time.sleep(0.01)
z_rest /= SAMPLES

# Beep to tell user we're starting recording
beep = Note('A6')
beep.play(0.2).wait()

# Record taps
TOTAL_TICKS = 2000
raw_tap_ticks = []
for i in range(TOTAL_TICKS):
    x, y, z = accel.forces()
    if abs(z_rest-z) &gt; 0.1:
        raw_tap_ticks.append(i)
    time.sleep(0.001)

# Beep to tell user we've stopped recording
beep.play(0.2).wait()

print(raw_tap_ticks)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 8 through 14, we calibrate the sensor. In a <code>for</code>
    loop, we sum the z-force on the accelerometer that we read
    <code>SAMPLES</code> times. After the <code>for</code> loop, we divide the
    sum by the number of <code>SAMPLES</code>. This gives us the average value
    of the z-force.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 17 and 18, we play a start beep so the user knows we've started
    recording.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 21 through 27, we record the user's taps. In a <code>for</code>
    loop, we test each tap to see if the force is greater than some threshold
    (0.1). If it is, we record the tap by appending it to the list
    <code>raw_tap_ticks</code>. Note: when we check to to see if the force is
    above a threshold, we subtract <code>z_rest</code> from our test, which
    makes sure that our test is calibrated.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 30, we play an end beep so the user knows we've stopped
    recording.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 32, we print out the "taps" that we've recorded.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Give it a try. After the start beep, gently tap a short rhythm on the
  CREATOR Kit. The output will show you the times that the taps occurred. The
  numbers that are printed are the time through the <code>for</code> loop that
  the tap occurred. For each tap, you might see a bunch of numbers close
  together in value. The reason is that when the tap occurs, the z-force will
  go wildly up and down for a few moments as the kit vibrates.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>What happens if you hold the kit off of the table while it is being
    calibrated? Why?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The taps were recorded for about 2 seconds. Can you double the length of
    time that taps get recorded?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The z-force threshold was arbitrarily chosen to be 0.1. Can you change
    this threshold to be more or less sensitive to taps? If the threshold is
    too low, then you'll record taps even when no one tapped. What is the
    smallest threshold you can use that doesn't record any taps if no one
    taps?</p>
