  <p>In this project, we will create a sprite of a person (this is actually
  the same sprite used by Minecraft for their main character, Steve), and we
  will draw and animate that sprite on the LED Matrix.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>Your breadboard should still have the circuit we wired in the <a data-uid=
  "ledp"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it should look like:
  <img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>In this project, we will create a sprite, and we will animate that sprite.
  In order to animate the sprite, we will create multiple versions of the sprite,
  and we will display the different versions of the sprite on our LED Matrix,
  one at a time.  If we rotate through the sprite images reasonably quickly, the
  sprites will appear as a continuous animation.  In this case, the animation will
  be of a person running.</p>

  <p>Here are the four sprites we will rotate through to create our animation:
  
  <p><img src="img/runningman.jpg" alt="">
  
  <p>If it's not completely obvious what the animation will look like based on those
  four sprite designs, just wait and see...
  
  <p>For our code, we will use the Game Loop format.  First, we'll do all of our
  initialization and define our sprites, then in a loop, we will cycle through
  our sprites, erasing/drawing/displaying each sprite in the sequence.</p>

  <p>Here is the code, which hopefully you'll find pretty straightforward at this
  point:</p>

    <p>Can you add a button that, when pressed, makes the running man jump?
    That is, displays him shifted up one or two points above the bottom of the

    flash on and off while still running?</p>

    <p>Can you add a fourth button that, when pressed, makes the running man
    change direction?</p>

   <li>

    <p>Challenging: Can you modify the first button so that it makes the
    running man jump gradually? That is, as he continues to run, slowly display
    him shifted up one point, then two points, then three points, then two
    points, then one point, then back to ground?</p>
