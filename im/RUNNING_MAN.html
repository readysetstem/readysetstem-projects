  <p><mark>Needs description for Running Man project</mark>In this project, we will continue to develop the moving dot from our
  previous project and add in a second axis of movement.</p>

  <p>In our last project, we learned how to move our dot on a single axis, but
  keep it from falling off the edge of the screen by setting and testing
  boundaries. In this project, we're going to start moving the dot on two axes
  (left and right; up and down) and learn how to constrain the dot on both axes
  so that it doesn't fall off the screen.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>Your breadboard should still have the circuit we wired in the <a data-uid=
  "ledp"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it should look like:
  <img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p><mark>Needs description for Running Man project</mark>Adding the same functionality along the other axis (the y-axis) is
  actually pretty simple. In addition to changing the x location by 1 each time
  through the loop, we also do the same with the y location. This requires
  another <code>direction</code> variable to keep track of the y-axis
  direction. To avoid confusion with the variable names, we'll also change the
  previous variable <code>direction</code> to <code>x_direction</code></p>

  <p>In addition, we need to increment in the y-direction each time through the
  loop and test whether we've hit the y-axis edge.</p>

  <p>Here is the final code, with the new code marked with arrows:</p>

    <p>Can you add a button that, when pressed, makes the running man jump?
    That is, displays him shifted up one or two points above the bottom of the
    display.</p>

   <li>

    <p>Can you add a second button that, when pressed, makes the running man go

    flash on and off while still running?</p>

    <p>Can you add a fourth button that, when pressed, makes the running man
    change direction?</p>

    <p>Challenging: Can you modify the first button so that it makes the
    running man jump gradually? That is, as he continues to run, slowly display
    him shifted up one point, then two points, then three points, then two
    points, then one point, then back to ground?</p>
