  <p>In this project, we'll build on the sprite animations we did in the
  LED Matrix 
  <a data-uid="running"></a>
   project by not only animating a running man on the LED Matrix, but also
  creating a synchronized animation of the running man in the Minecraft world. What we
  draw on the LED Matrix will be replicated in blocks in the Minecraft
  world.</p>

  <p>Our code for this project will be identical to the previous project, with
  one addition &mdash; a function that will be used to replicate the animation we're
  doing on the LED Matrix in the Minecraft world as well.</p>

  <p>When you give this code a try, don't forget to look around to find the running man!

  <h2><code>sprite_in_minecraft()</code> Function</h2>

  <p>We've created a function that will animate our character as we define in
  the Minecraft world. Unlike the LED Matrix, where we can use a simple API to
  pass in an 8x8 design with a single function call, to create a design in the
  Minecraft world, we need to draw block by block. For that reason, a major
  purpose of our function is to turn our 8x8 list of 0's and non-0's into
  blocks (for the non-0's) and air (for the 0's).</p>

  <p>Let's discuss what our function does, line-by-line:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 56, we define our function, which takes three arguments as inputs:
    our Minecraft object, the current 8x8 design that we want to draw and the
    location of our character (where we want to draw).</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 57, we take our 8x8 design that we used to draw on our LED
    Matrix and we rearrange it in an order that will allow us to draw it in the
    Minecraft world. Specifically, we break up the design into the eight lines
    we defined in our list (using the <code>splitlines()</code> function and
    reverse the lines to go from bottom to top, since we will draw starting
    from the ground (using the <code>reversed()</code> function.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 58 and 59, we "nest" (put one inside the other) two
    <code>for</code> loops. This will allow us to run through each of the eight
    horizontal characters and each of the eight rows and execute the code that
    follows the nested loops.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 60 through 64, we have the code that will be executed for each of the 64
    (8x8) character positions. The code checks the character and if it's a 0
    (which is equivalent to an off LED), it sets the block type to air, which
    is the same as not drawing a block. If the character is a non-0 (which is
    equivalent to the LED being on in that position), it sets the block type to
    wood, so you'll see the block at that location. The final line uses <code>setBlock()</code>
    to draw the block.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    <code>enumerate()</code> Function
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>In the two <code>for</code> loops above, we use the
    built-in <code>enumerate</code> function. This function allows us to track the count
    of how many times we've gone through the <code>for</code> loop &mdash; we call
    this the "index", it starts at 0 and it is stored in the first variable of
    the loop.</p>

    <p>Here's an example:</p>

    <pre>
<code>animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']</code>
<code>for index, animal in (enumerate(animals)):</code>
    <code>print(index, animal)</code>
</pre>

    <p>This code would output:</p>

<pre>
0 dog
1 cat
2 bird
</pre>

    <p>We made the running man out of wood.  Can you change the type of block
   that the running man is made of?

   Can you make the running man out of stripes?  That is, can you use
   different materials for the odd and even rows?

   Can you make the running man out of random materials?

   We made the running man stand straight up in the Minecraft world (on the X
