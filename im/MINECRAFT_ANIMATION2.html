  <p>In this project, we'll build on the sprite animations we did in the
  LED Matrix 
  <a data-uid="running"></a>
   project by not only animating a running man on the LED Matrix, but also
  creating a synchronized animation of the running man in the Minecraft world. What we
  draw on the LED Matrix will be replicated in blocks in the Minecraft
  world.</p>

 <p>This project will only require the LED Matrix display.  Here is what your

  <p>Our code for this project will be identical to our code in the

  <p>When you give this code a try, don't forget to look around to find the running man!

  <h2><code>sprite_in_minecraft()</code> Function</h2>

  <p>We've created a function that will animate our character in
  the Minecraft world. Unlike the LED Matrix, where we can use a simple API to
  pass in an 8x8 design (a sprite) with a single function call, to create a design in the
  Minecraft world, we need to draw it block-by-block. For that reason, the bulk
  of our function is used to turn our 8x8 list of 0's and non-0's into
  blocks (for the non-0's) and air (for the 0's).</p>

  <p>Let's discuss what our function does, line-by-line:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 56, we define our function, which takes three arguments as inputs:
    our Minecraft object, the current 8x8 design that we want to draw and the
    location of our character (where we want to draw it).</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 57, we take our 8x8 design that we drew on our LED
    Matrix and we rearrange it in an order that will allow us to draw it in the
    Minecraft world. Specifically, we break up the design into the eight separate
	lines (using the <code>splitlines()</code> function) and then we
    reverse the order of the lines from bottom to top (using the 
	<code>reversed()</code> function), as we will draw starting from the ground 
	and moving up.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 58 and 59, we <i>nest</i> (put one inside the other) two
    <code>for</code> loops. This will allow us to run through each of the eight
    horizontal characters and each of the eight rows and execute the code that
    follows the nested loops.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 60 through 64, we have implemented the code that will be used to
	create blocks at each of 64 (8x8) character positions. The code checks the character, 
	and if it's a 0 (which is equivalent to the LED being <i>off</i> in that position), 
	it sets the block type to AIR, which is the same as not drawing a block. If the 
	character is a non-0 (which is equivalent to the LED being <i>on</i> in that position), 
	it sets the block type to wood, so we'll see the block at that location. The final 
	line of that code block uses the <code>setBlock()</code> function to draw the 
	appropriate block.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    <code>enumerate()</code> Function
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>In the two <code>for</code> loops above, we use the
    built-in <code>enumerate</code> function. This function allows us to track the count
    of how many times we've gone through the <code>for</code> loop &mdash; we call
    this the "index", it starts at 0 and it is stored in the first variable of
    the loop.</p>

    <p>Here's an example:</p>

    <pre>
<code>animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']</code>
<code>for index, animal in (enumerate(animals)):</code>
    <code>print(index, animal)</code>
</pre>

    <p>This code would output:</p>

<pre>
0 dog
1 cat
2 bird
</pre>

    <p>We made the running man out of wood.  Can you change the type of block
   that the running man is made of?

   Can you make the running man out of stripes?  That is, can you use
   different materials for the odd and even rows?
   </p> </li> <li> <p>
   Can you make the running man out of randomly generated materials for each
   block?
   </p> </li> <li> <p>
   We made the running man stand straight up in the Minecraft world (on the X
   and Y axes).  Can you lay the running man down flat (on the X and Z axes)?
