  <h1>WHILE Loops</h1>

  <p><code>while</code> loops allow your program to repeat a certain piece of
  code over and over as long as some specific condition is met.</p>

  <p><code>while</code> loops are used as follows:</p>
  <pre>
while (condition):
    If condition is True, execute this code block
    .
    .
    .
    Go back to the top of the loop and test condition again

When condition is False, continue here...
</pre>

  <p>As an example, imagine you want to write some code to build a countdown
  timer. The code would start at a specified number of seconds (let's say 60),
  and then count backwards — once per second — until the timer reached zero. At
  that point, an alarm would go off.</p>

  <p>The code for this application is pretty simple:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Create a variable (let's call it <code>time_left</code>) and set it to
    60.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>If <code>time_left</code> has reached 0, jump to Step #5.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Subtract 1 from <code>time_left</code> and wait a second.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Go back to Step #2</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Sound the alarm!</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>You'll notice that Steps #2-4 will repeat many times (60, to be exact)
  before our variable gets to 0 and we jump to Step #5. The easiest way to
  implement that repeating code is to use a <code>while</code> loop, as
  follows:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
time_left = 60

while (time_left &gt; 0):
    time_left = time_left - 1
    time.sleep(1)

sound_the_alarm()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In our code above, the first line sets our variable <code>time_left</code>
  to 60.</p>

  <p>Next, we use a <code>while</code> loop to test whether
  <code>time_left</code> equals 0 or not. If the expression <code>(time_left
  &gt; 0)</code> tests <code>True</code> (i.e., we haven't yet gotten to zero), we subtract
  1 from <code>time_left</code> and go back to the top to test the expression
  again.</p>

  <p>We continue this loop until the expression tests <code>False</code> (i.e., our variable
  gets to 0), at which point we drop through the loop and start executing the
  code below it.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>while True:</h1>

  <p><code>while</code> loops are tremendously powerful, and you'll likely be
  using them very often. One of the most basic types of <code>while</code>
  loops — and also one of the most common — is a loop that will execute
  forever. In fact, that's the point of it — it will keep going until someone
  explicitly stops the program.</p>

  <p>It is written as follows:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
while True:
    CODE_BLOCK_HERE
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Because the expression "True" always evaluates to <code>True</code>, this code block
  will loop over and over forever until the program is stopped by the user.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>BREAK Free</h1>

  <p>One more thing to note — sometimes we want to stop running a loop while
  we're in the middle of executing the code block, even if the expression that
  we were testing still tests <code>True</code>. This can be accomplished by using the
  <code>break</code> keyword from within the loop, and will immediately drop
  through the loop to the code below.</p>

  <p>Here's an example:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
while True:
    CODE_BLOCK_HERE
    if SELF_DESTRUCT_PRESSED:
        break;

run_self_destruct_sequence()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In the code above, we are running in a loop forever, but at one point during each
  time through the loop, we're testing for some condition (in this case, we're
  testing to see if a SELF DESTRUCT button was pressed!), and if that condition
  tests as <code>True</code>, we drop through the loop.</p>
