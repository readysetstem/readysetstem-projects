  <p>In this project, we will add in an LED Matrix and create a "balancing dot"
  &mdash; a single dot on the LED Matrix that moves around as we tilt the
  CREATOR Kit.  For this project, to keep things simple, we will only move the
  dot left and right on the LED Matrix.

 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>You'll need to wire up both the Accelerometer and LED Matrix as done in
  previous projects.  Here is what your breadboard should look like once the
  accelerometer is properly wired:</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src=
  "img/LED_Matrix_Accel_bb.jpg" alt=""></div>
 </div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>For our first try, we're simply going to put a single dot on the screen and
  have it move left when the CREATOR Kit is tilted left, or move right when the
  CREATOR Kit is tilted right.
  <p>Most of the code should be very familiar, as it comes from the initial 
  <a data-uid="ledp"></a> project and <a data-uid="accelp"></a> project.  The code that's new is
  highlighted with arrows, below:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

fb = FrameBuffer()
accel = Accel()

*TILT_FORCE = 0.1
*STEP = 0.1
*x, y = (3, 3)
while True:
    x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
    
*    if x_force &gt; TILT_FORCE:
*        x -= STEP
*    elif x_force &lt; -TILT_FORCE:
*        x += STEP

    fb.erase()
*    fb.point(round(x), round(y))
    fb.show()
    
    time.sleep(.1)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The new additions we've made are (highlighted with arrows above):</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>
    On Line 8, we define the <code>TILT_FORCE</code>.  The <code>TILT_FORCE</code> is how much we have to tilt the
    CREATOR Kit to make the dot move.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
    On Line 9, we define the <code>STEP</code>.  The <code>STEP</code> is how much we should move
    the dot while the CREATOR Kit is being tilted.  Note that <code>STEP</code> is small &mdash;
    it's less than one.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
    On Line 10, we define the starting coordinates of the dot.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
    On Lines 14 through 17, we move the dot if the CREATOR Kit is tilted.  The first part says: if
    the kit is tilted to the left (greater than the <code>TILT_FORCE</code>), then decrease the x
    position.  Alternatively, if tilted right (a negative <code>TILT_FORCE</code>), then increase
    the x position.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
    On Line 20, we draw the dot.  Notice that we use the built-in function
    <code>round()</code>.  We need this because our x position moves by
    fractional <code>STEP</code>s.  So, our x position is fractional, too
    &mdash; it might be something like 3.2.  However, the coordinates on the
    LED Matrix are <i>integers</i>.  Therefore, we must round them to the
    nearest integer (using the <code>round()</code> function).
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li> <p>
   Can you make the dot move faster when tilted?
    </p> </li> <li> <p>
   While keep the code above the same (that allows you to balance the dot left and right), can you
   add code to change the row (y coordinate) that the dot is on?  You can change the row randomly,
   or in sequential order.
