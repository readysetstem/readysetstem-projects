  <p>In this project, we continue the development of our Alien Intruders game
  by initializing and getting movement input from our accelerometer.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was
  completed for the <a data-uid="ai1"></a> project. Here's a reminder:
  <img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_Accel_Buttons_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>In the last project, we initialized our ship where it's supposed to start
  and we created the loop for our game loop. In this project, we're going to
  add the accelerometer and use it to get input from the user about which
  direction to move our ship (tilting the Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit left will
  move the ship left and tilting right will move the ship right). In this
  project, we'll use that input to animate the movement of our ship.</p>

  <p>As we learned in <a data-uid="accel"></a>, the initialization code for the
  accelerometer will consist of importing the <code>Accel()</code> function and
  then initializing the accelerometer:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
accel = Accel()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We also need to create and define two other variables that we'll need at
  this point:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p><strong>TILT_FORCE:</strong> If we tilt the accelerometer right or left,
    it will register an X force greater than 0 (if we tilt left) or less than 0
    (if we tilt right). In theory, any value greater than 0 is a left tilt and
    any value less than 0 is a right tilt. But, because the accelerometer is
    very sensitive, even if we try to hold it perfectly flat, it will likely
    register at least a tiny bit of tilt. So, to give us a margin of error,
    we're going to assume that the accelerometer needs to be tilted at least a
    certain amount before we register it as a tilt. If we want the game to be
    very sensitive to tilting, we can set this value close to 0 (so just a
    small tilt will register); if we don't want the game to be very sensitive,
    we can set the value close to 1 (so only a large tilt will register). And
    we'll start by setting the value to .1 and see how that works for us.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>SPACESHIP_STEP:</strong> As we register tilt in one direction or
    the other, we need to have the ship move in that direction. And we need to
    tell it how far to move during one pass through the game loop if a tilt is
    registered. If we move it too far each time, the ship will appear to move
    very fast and we'll feel like we have no control over it; if we move it too
    small of a distance each time, the game will feel sluggish and
    non-responsive. Most likely, we'll just want the ship to move a fraction of
    a dot each time a tilt is registered. We'll start with .1 dots for now and
    see how that works for us.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In our initialization section for the ship, we can set these values:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Initialize the spaceship
TILT_FORCE = 0.1
SPACESHIP_STEP = 0.1
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now that the accelerometer is initialized, we can use it to get input from
  the controller. We do this just like we did in the <a data-uid="accel"></a>
  project:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Check for user input
x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Next, we can add code to move the ship based on the input we've received
  from the accelerometer:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Draw the spaceship
if x_force &gt; TILT_FORCE: 
    spaceship_position -= SPACESHIP_STEP
elif x_force &lt; -TILT_FORCE: 
    spaceship_position += SPACESHIP_STEP
spaceship_position = max(0, min(fb.width - 1, spaceship_position))
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is the full code for our game at this point (with new changes
  highlighted with arrows) &mdash;  when you run it, try
  tilting your Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit left and right, and you should see
  your ship move left and right in response:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">

   The <code>TILT_FORCE</code> is the minimum amount of tilt that makes the
   spaceship move.  Can you decrease this to zero to make a very sensitive
   controller?
    </p> </li> <li> <p>
    Once the kit is tilted enough (more than <code>TILT_FORCE</code>), the
    spaceship moves at a constant speed.  Tilting really far doesn't make it
    move faster.  Can you modify the code so that the more you tilt, the faster
    the spaceship moves?
