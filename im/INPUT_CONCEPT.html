  <h1>Inputs</h1>

  <p>In our previous GPIO concept, we focused on how we could control our
  circuit from our code (GPIO as Outputs). This concept will focus on the other
  aspect of how GPIOs are used — to allow the outside world (our circuits) to
  communicate with our code. This is important because we often want to trigger
  our code to do certain things or take certain actions based on input or
  changes coming from our circuit.</p>

  <p>For example, our code might count the number of times a button is pressed
  in a short a period of time — if the button is pressed once, have our code do
  one thing and if the button is pressed twice, have our code do something
  else. In this way, we've added "intelligence" to our button presses. When our
  hardware can communicate directly with our code, we open a world of
  possibilities.</p>

  <p>So, how do we do this? By using GPIOs as inputs.</p>
  <h2>GPIOs As Inputs</h2>

  <p>Much like how GPIO outputs work by simply setting a voltage on the GPIO pin to
  either low (0V) or high (3.3V), GPIO inputs work by reading the voltage —
  either 0V or 3.3V — being sent to the GPIO pin by the attached
  component:</p><img style="width: 450px;" alt="" src="img/gpio_input.jpg">

  <p>For example, a GPIO can be used to get the current state of a button or
  switch (pressed or released). Based on the current state, the software can do
  what we define when the button/switch is in that state.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    "State"
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>"State" is a common term used in electronics and just means the current
    condition or situation of a component or circuit. For example, in the case
    of a button or switch, state would refer to whether the button is currently
    being pressed or released. For an LED, state might refer to whether the LED
    was illuminated or not.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>For a component to communicate with our code, instead of wiring the
  component directly into the rest of the circuit, we instead wire the
  component directly to a GPIO. Typically, a component wired to a GPIO input
  would either generate 0V or 3.3V and the GPIO input would read that voltage
  and communicate it to our code so that the code knows about the "state" of
  the component.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Floating Inputs
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>A GPIO can "read" one of two states: a high voltage (3.3V) or a low
    voltage (0V). But what happens if the GPIO input is not hooked up to a
    circuit at all and we try to read that input? What voltage would it
    read?</p>

    <p>An input that is not hooked up might be read as a high voltage or might
    be read as a low voltage (though the actual voltage at the GPIO could be
    anything). We typically refer to this undefined state as a "floating
    input", and is usually not what we want. In this situation, if you read the
    input twice in a row, you might get two different results!</p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <h2>GPIO Example: Buttons</h2>

  <p>A simple way to think about GPIO inputs is with a button. Buttons are
  actually a little bit different than some other devices that would be used
  with a GPIO input, as they don't generate a voltage (so we can't just read
  their voltage at the GPIO). But, with a little bit of behind-the-scenes
  configuration, we can wire a circuit so that our button uses a GPIO input and
  we can read the state of the button based on the voltages generated.</p>

  <p>This is what the schematic would look like for a button wired to a GPIO as
  an input:</p><img class="schematic" style="width:350px;" src=
  "img/Pushbutton-to-GPIO.png" alt="">

  <p>This circuit works because the default GPIO voltage is set to 3.3V (that's the
  behind-the-scenes configuration we mentioned above, but not shown in the
  schematic). When the button is unpressed (circuit open), the GPIO reads the
  3.3V default voltage. But, when the button is pressed, the circuit is closed,
  the GPIO gets "pulled low" (meaning it gets forced to 0V by being directly
  connected to ground), and will read 0V.</p>

  <p>With this wiring and configuration, the code can measure the voltage at
  the GPIO and know if the button is pressed (if we read 0V at the GPIO) or
  unpressed (if we read 3.3V at the GPIO).</p>

  <p>We'll explore GPIO inputs more in our next project, and will be using GPIO
  inputs when wiring buttons in all future projects.</p>
