  <p>In this project, we'll finish the development of our Simon Says 
  pattern-matching game by adding a final sequence when the player loses.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was
  completed for the <a data-uid="simon2"></a> project. Here's a reminder:
  <img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-4led_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>The last piece of our game is to add in a final sequence for when the user
  makes a mistake and we drop through the <code>while</code> loop.</p>

  <p>When this happens, we want to do the following:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>If the user has lost due to a time-out (he didn't hit a button in time),
    we light up all the LEDs</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>If the user has lost due to hitting a wrong button in the sequence, we
    light up the LED that was incorrectly pressed</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We then play an error tone</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Finally, we play the correct sequence one last time (quickly)</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here is what that code will look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Game Over — Play error sequence
if button_pressed == None:
    for light in lights:
        light.on()
else:
    lights[button_pressed].on()

you_failed_note.play(1.5).wait()

for light in lights:
    light.off()

time.sleep(0.5)

# Play correct sequence fast
for i in play_order:
    lights[i].on()
    notes[i].play(0.1).wait()
    lights[i].off()
    time.sleep(0.05)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is what the final code for this project looks like (with new changes
  highlighted with arrows) — go have some fun playing and don't forget to try
  the challenges!</p>

  <p>You now have a basic Simon Says game you can play, but there are many
  variations you can try. How complex you go with any variation is up to your
  own imagination:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Reverse: Have the user repeat the sequence of button presses in
    reverse.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Inverted Lights: For each button in the play sequence, light up all 3 of
    the LEDs NOT next to the button. The gameplay is the same, but it is much
    more confusing to remember which button to press.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Mixed Inverted Lights: Sometimes invert the LEDs (as suggested above),
    and sometimes don't — but do this randomly.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Two at a Time: Do a random sequence that displays two LEDs on at the
    same time.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Onesie Twosie: Sometimes display two LEDs at the same time (as suggested
    above), and sometimes don't — but do this randomly.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Fast Match: Display a sequence of 5 (or so) LEDs really fast — perhaps
    with just a tenth of a second between each LED flash. Then have the user
    repeat the whole sequence correctly.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Make Your Own: The real fun is in making your own game by mashing-up the
    suggested projects or challenges together, or creating something completely new!</p>
