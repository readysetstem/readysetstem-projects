  <p>In this project, we finish the development of our Simon Says pattern
  matching game by adding a final win/lose sequence.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was
  completed for the <a data-uid="simon2"></a> project. Here's a reminder:
  <img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-4led_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">
  <p>In this project, we're going to add in our final sequence when the user
  makes a mistake and we drop through the <code>while</code> loop.</p>

  <p>When this happens, we want to do the following:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>If the user has lost due to a time-out (he didn't hit a button in time),
    we light up all the LEDs</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>If the user has lost due to hitting a wrong button in the sequence, we
    light up the LED that was incorrectly pressed</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>We then play an error tone</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Finally, we play the correct sequence one last time (quickly)</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here is what that code will look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Game Over &mdash; Play error sequence
if button_pressed == None:
    for light in lights:
        light.on()
else:
    lights[button_pressed].on()

you_failed_note.play(1.5).wait()

for light in lights:
    light.off()

time.sleep(0.5)

# Play correct sequence fast
for i in play_order:
    lights[i].on()
    notes[i].play(0.1).wait()
    lights[i].off()
    time.sleep(0.05)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is what the final code for this project looks like 
  (with new changes highlighted with arrows) &mdash;
  go have some
  fun playing and don't forget to try the challenges!

  <p>You now have a basic Simon Says game you can play, but there are many variations you can try.  How
  complex you go with any variation is up to your own imagination:
  <ol>
   <li> <p>
   Reverse: Have the user repeat the sequence of button presses in reverse.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   Inverted Lights: For each button in the play sequence, light up all 3 of the LEDs NOT next to
   the button.  The gameplay is the same, but it is much more confusing to remember which button to
   press.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   Mixed Inverted Lights: Sometimes invert the LEDs (as suggested above), and
   sometimes don't &mdash; but do this randomly.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   Two at a Time: Do a random sequence that displays two LEDs on at the same time.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   Onesie Twosie: Sometimes display two LEDs at the same time (as suggested above), and
   sometimes don't &mdash; but do this randomly.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   Fast Match: Display a sequence of 5 (or so) LEDs really fast &mdash; perhaps with just a tenth
   of a second between each LED flash.  Then have the user repeat the whole sequence correctly.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   Make Your Own: The real fun is in making your own.  Mashup and of the suggested projects or
   challenges together, or create a completely new idea!
