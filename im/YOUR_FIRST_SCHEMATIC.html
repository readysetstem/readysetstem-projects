  <h1>USING THE BREADBOARD</h1>

  <p>When it comes to building circuits in real life, pinching and holding
  wires together with your fingers as we did in the <a data-uid="yfc"></a>
  project isn't very practical.</p>

  <p>When building electronics in real life, we often want to first build
  temporary circuits that are easy to modify — this lets you "play around" with
  the circuit and work out the kinks in your design; then, once you have a
  temporary circuit that is working exactly the way you want, you can use the
  design as the basis for creating a permanent circuit, which would likely
  involve soldering your circuit together (connecting your circuit together
  with melted metal or giving a design of your circuit to manufacturing
  company to build for you).</p>

  <p>One of the most common ways of building a temporary circuit involves the
  use of a "breadboard." The name breadboard stems from the fact that early
  electronics hobbyists would often use the large wooden boards designed for
  rolling out and cutting bread dough to house their temporary circuits.</p>

  <p>The breadboards used to build electronics are often called "solderless"
  breadboards, which can help avoid confusion when talking to your pastry chef
  friends. <big>😃</big></p>
  <h2>Breadboard Layout</h2>

  <p>Breadboards come in many shapes and sizes, but the fundamental components
  will remain the same:</p><img style="max-width: 600px;"
  src="img/breadboard_example_1.png" alt="">

  <p>We'll get to the purpose of each of these parts in a moment, but the key
  to a breadboard's usefulness is how the various areas are electrically
  connected. Those connections are illustrated here — the first picture
  indicates which rows and columns of holes are connected together and the
  second picture is the inside of the breadboard, so you can actually see
  <i>how</i> the connections between holes are made using pieces of metal:</p>
  <table class="basic" style="margin:auto; width:100%">
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><img style="" alt="" src="img/breadboard_example_2.png"></td>
     <td><img style="" alt="" src="img/breadboard_back.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td><strong>Example of Breadboard Connections</strong></td>
     <td><strong>Actual Inside of Breadboard (Bottom View)</strong></td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>As you can see, each of the two rails consists of two long rows of
  connections (a red row in each rail and a blue row in each rail). There are
  spaces between the groups of holes in the rail, but the entire row is still
  electrically connected as indicated.</p>

  <p>In the center of the board, each vertical column of five holes (shown
  highlighted in green) is electrically connected together. While we only
  highlighted a few columns of five-hole connected strips, in actuality, every
  columns of five holes is a connected strip. It's important to note that there
  is no electrical connection across the notch.</p>

  <p>If you recall from <a data-uid="electronics"></a>, in order to have a
  closed circuit, electric charge must be able to flow from power, through the
  circuit, to ground. A breadboard makes it easy to wire a circuit in this
  fashion — the rails denote the power and ground of the circuit, while the
  rest of the breadboard provides space for your components and the connections
  between those components.</p>

  <p>When inserting components, like resistors, into the holes of the breadboard, be sure to pinch
  the components tightly toward the bottom of the lead (the metal wire part) of
  the component (see the diagram below).  If you don't, the leads can easily
  get bent out of shape!</p>
  <img alt=""
  style="max-width: 600px;" src="img/breadboard-600.gif">

  <p>One last thing to remember — breadboards themselves provide no power. All
  they do is allow you to connect components together so that when you
  provide power, current will flow from one component to another. Power to a
  breadboard can be provided in many different ways, and we'll explore several
  of those over the next few projects. As you'll see, most of the project in
  this kit will be powered directly from the Raspberry Pi.</p>

  <h1>YOUR FIRST SCHEMATIC</h1>
  <!--Eventually, I think we should break this out into a separate concept
  with a corresponding project &mdash; perhaps just showing some basic schematics
  and having them wire the breadboard in the same configuration.-->

  <p>In the real world, building circuits often starts with a "schematic" for
  the circuit. Just like a blueprint tells a builder exactly how to build a
  house, a schematic tells an engineer how to build a circuit.</p>

  <p>A schematic for a circuit might look something like this:</p><img style=
  "max-width: 600;" src=
  "img/Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m4aa427eb.png" alt=""> 
  <!--Should we change this to one of our own schematics?-->

  <p>Looks pretty complicated, huh?</p>

  <p>In reality, its pretty straightforward. Let's look at the parts of a
  schematic step-by-step...</p>
  <h2>The Parts &amp; Their Symbols</h2>

  <p>Schematics use symbols to represent all the common parts you will find in
  a circuit. The symbols don't always look like the parts they represent, so
  we've provided a little cheat-sheet right here:</p>
  <style>
        tbody#partstable p { 
        font-size: 14pt;
        font-weight: bold;
        text-align: center; 
        }
        tbody#partstable img { 
        background: transparent;
            padding: 0;
        }
  </style>
  <table class="basic">
   <tbody id="partstable">
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Battery</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:100px;" src="img/Parts-battery.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Button</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:100px;" src="img/Parts-button.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Capacitor</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:100px;" src="img/Parts-capacitor.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Ground</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:50px;" src="img/Parts-ground.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>LED</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:100px;" src="img/Parts-led.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Light Sensor</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:100px;" src="img/Parts-light-sensor.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Lightbulb</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:80px;" src="img/Parts-lightbulb.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Resistor</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:100px;" src="img/Parts-resistor.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Speaker</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:70px;" src="img/Parts-speaker.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>

      <p>Transistor</p>
     </td>
     <td><img style="width:70px;" src="img/Parts-transistor.png"></td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>You may see some slight variations between how some of these components are
  drawn, but if you use the chart above as your reference, you should be able
  to figure out these basic components in any schematic.</p>

  <p>You'll also notice that in some cases, the symbols may contain (+) and (-)
  signs that indicate which side of the part is which &mdash; for example, which side
  of the battery is the positive (+) side and which is the negative (-) side.
  And in some cases, you'll see a number next to a part indicating what size of
  that part to use – for example, a resistor may have something like "100 Ω"
  next to it, indicating that the resistor should be "100 ohm" in size.</p>
  <h2>Connecting the Parts</h2>

  <p>In a schematic, you'll notice that all the parts are attached to each
  other by lines. These lines represent the wires through which electric
  current in the circuit flows.</p>

  <p>Wiring a circuit is as easy as attaching the wires to the parts (and to
  each other) as indicated in the schematic. If you can replicate the drawing
  using real wires and parts, your circuit will work as expected.</p>

  <p>Let's use the following schematic as an example:</p><img class="schematic"
  alt="" src="img/Battery-LED-Circuit.png">

  <p>Does this look familiar? It is the same circuit from the project
  <a data-uid="yfc"></a>.</p>
  <h2>Closing the Loop</h2>

  <p>You probably noticed in our schematic above that the entire
  circuit made a loop. This makes sense given our definition of a circuit as
  needing to be a closed loop for it to work (remember, in an open circuit,
  electric charge can't flow). Conceptually, we can think of the electric
  charge as flowing through the circuit starting at the (+) terminal of the
  battery and finishing at the (-) terminal of the battery, the ground.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    How can a loop have a start?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Above, we said that we can conceptually think of the electric charge as
    starting at one point and ending at another. The reason we say
    "conceptually" is that, in actuality, the particles that create electric
    charge already exist at all points in a closed circuit, so the electric
    charge doesn't really "start" at any point. But, since the (+) terminal of the
    battery is the highest point of voltage, it's easy to think of the flow
    starting there in a circuit diagram.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>A good way to think about current flow through a circuit is to assume that
  the flow starts at the positive end of a power source and finishes at the
  ground of that power source. And in many schematics — like the one we've been
  using above — the circuit will appear as a closed loop, starting at one side
  of the power source and completing at the other side. While this is how
  circuits work, it's not always convenient to draw circuits in a closed loop.
  In complex schematics, having to draw everything in a loop can make the
  drawings very difficult to follow.</p>

  <p>This is why schematics will often separate the two sides of the power
  source, with the power source at the top of the schematic and the ground at
  the bottom. This convention makes the schematic much simpler to read (and to
  write when you're the one creating the schematic).</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at how our schematic above would typically be drawn in
  the real world:</p><img style="width: 184px; height: 414px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-LED-Circuit-Unlooped.png">

  <p>The circuit that this schematic represents is exactly the same as the
  circuit we presented above (the one in the shape of a loop). At the top of
  the schematic is the power source — indicated by the "3.3V". Just like in our
  previous schematic drawing, the power source is connected to the resistor,
  which is then connected to the LED.</p>

  <p>In this schematic diagram, the other lead of the LED doesn't loop back to
  the power source, but instead connects to a symbol that represents "ground."
  In the real world, the circuit would connect back to the (-) side of the
  power source (which is ground), but in the diagram, the power and ground are
  separated to make the diagram simpler and easier to read.</p>
