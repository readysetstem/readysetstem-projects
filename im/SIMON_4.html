  <p>In this project, we continue the development of our Simon Says pattern
  matching game by adding randomized LED blinking.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was
  completed for the <a data-uid="simon2"></a> project. Here's a reminder:
  <img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-4led_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>In our last project, we wrote some code to flash LEDs in a preplanned
  sequence. While that's a good start, in our Simon Says game, we're going to
  need to flash LEDs in a random sequence. This will require us to make some
  modifications to the code from the last project, which will give us a random
  sequence of LED flashes.</p>

  <p>In the next project, we'll add in the buttons.</p>
  <h3 class="step">Add Initialization Code</h3>

  <p>Starting with the code we left off with in the previous project, the first
  thing we'll need to do is import the function <code>randrange()</code> to
  create our random generation of LED flashes:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
from random import randrange
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h3 class="step">Create a List for LED Flashes &amp; Generate First LED</h3>

  <p>Next, instead of filling the list <code>play_order</code> with our
  predefined sequence of LED flashes, we're going to create an empty list that
  we can fill with random sequence of flashes.</p>

  <p>To do that, we'll replace the list we created previously with a new
  (empty) list:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
play_order = []
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Finally, we'll have to create our random sequence of LEDs. Each round of
  the game, we'll want to add one random LED to the end of the
  <code>play_order</code> list. The following line of code is a shorthand to
  append an item to a list (in this case, the item is a random number from 0 to
  3):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
play_order += [randrange(4)]
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h3 class="step">Play the List of LED Flashes</h3>

  <p>If we add this code to our previous code that includes the play sequence,
  we'll see that we're adding a single random LED flash to our sequence list
  and then flashing it:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = []

# Add another random LED to sequence
play_order += [randrange(4)]

# Ensure all lights are off
for light in lights: 
    light.off()

# Play sequence
for i in play_order:
    lights[i].on()
    time.sleep(0.4)
    lights[i].off()
    time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h3 class="step">Use a Loop to Generate an LED Sequence</h3>

  <p>If we add a <code>while</code> loop, we can continue to generate a random
  LED and add it to the list each time through the loop. This will play the
  entire sequence of random LED flashes, add a new LED to the sequence, play
  the list again with the new LED added, and then repeat:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = []

# Ensure all lights are off
for light in lights: 
    light.off()

while True:
      # Add another random LED to sequence
      play_order += [randrange(4)]
      
      # Play sequence
      for i in play_order:
          lights[i].on()
          time.sleep(0.4)
          lights[i].off()
          time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h3 class="step">Put It All Together</h3>

  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point --
  when you run it, you will see a random LED flash, then that light will repeat
  with a second random light added, then that 2-light sequence will repeat with
  a third added and so on (the sequence will continue until you stop the
  program):</p>
