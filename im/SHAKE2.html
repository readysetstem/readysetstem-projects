  <p>In this project, we'll add sounds to our accelerometer shake game.  With sounds, specfically
  text-to-speech like we used in the 
    <a data-uid= "speechp"></a> project, we can command the user to do different actions through
    the game, and let them know if the've succeeded.

 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>You'll need to wire up the Accelerometer as done in previous projects.
  Here is what your breadboard should look like once the accelerometer is
  properly wired:</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="bb" src=
  "img/Accel_bb.jpg" alt=""></div>
 <p>In addition, you'll need the speaker hooked up &mdash; refer back to the <a
 data-uid= "playingnotes"></a> project if you need help.

 <div id="sw" class="section">
  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point (with
  new changes highlighted with arrows) &mdash;
  it should run similarly to the previous project, but with sound added:</p>

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
   <li> <p>
   In Lines 5 through 15, we create the <code>Speech()</code> that we'll
   play throughout the program.  We'll also set up a list,
   <code>actions_tts</code>, that is the speech for each action that a user can
   take.  The list is in the same order as the variables <code>NOACTION</code>,
   <code>LEFT</code>, etc, which is important.  We'll use this list to let the
   user know which action we've detected.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   In Line 15, we let the user know the game is starting.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   In Line 32, we request the user to perform an specific tilt.  Of course, in this version of the
   game, the tilt is still always just LEFT!  (Don't worry, we'll change it next project).
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   In Lines 47 through 53, instead of just printing out if the right or wrong action was peformed,
   we speak to the user.  And, it was wrong, we tell them the action that we think they did.
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   In Line 58, we let the user know the game has ended.
  </ul>
  <p>Give it a try.  The game is still exeptionally easy &mdash; you are only every requested to
  tilt left, so it's hard to fail.  We'll make this into a real game in the next project.
