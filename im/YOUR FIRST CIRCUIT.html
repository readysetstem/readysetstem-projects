<H1>YOUR FIRST CIRCUIT</H1>
<P >In this project,
you’re going to create your first electric circuit.  But, before we
do that, some introductory discussion would probably be helpful. 
Let’s talk about some of the basic of electricity, circuits and how
they work.</P>
<H2>INTRODUCTION TO CIRCUITS</H2>
<P>While we don’t
intend this to be a complete textbook on electricity and circuits,
there are some basic concepts you will want/need to understand to
help you on your path of creating and programming electronics.  The
information below should be enough to get you started, but as you
gain some experience building circuits, you’ll no doubt find that
you have more questions and will be ready for more in-depth
discussion of the topic.  On our website, we link to a lot of great
resources that can provide deeper understanding of how and why
electricity works the way it does.</P>
<H3>What is Electricity</H3>
<P>Simply stated,
electricity is a flow of charged particles (electrons).  When
electricity is allowed a constant flow, it creates energy – energy
that can be used to power everything from a light bulb to an entire
city.  All of our everyday electronic gadgets – from cell phones to
computers to microwave ovens – are powered by electricity.</P>
<H3>What is a Circuit?</H3>
<P>A circuit is a
closed loop that allows electricity to flow through it.  A typical
circuit has a power source (something that provides electricity) and
various components that do stuff when electricity passes through
them.  For example, a circuit may contain a battery and a lightbulb. 
The battery provides the electricity and the lightbulb uses the
electricity to illuminate.</P>
<P>Some circuits are
very simple (like our battery and lightbulb example), while other
circuits are very complicated, containing many electricity sources
and many components.</P>
<H3>Voltage, Current &amp; Resistance</H3>
<P>When discussing
electricity and circuits, there are three major components that are
important to understand:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Voltage</P>
	<LI><P>Current</P>
	<LI><P>Resistance</P>
</OL>
<P>These three things
define how and when electricity flows, and controlling these aspects
of electricity allows us to harness the power that electricity
provides.  While we can’t actually see voltage, current or
resistance, there are some analogies we can use to help understand
what each of these things are and how each of these components
interacts with the others.</P>
<P>Remember how we said
that electricity is a flow of charged particles.  Well, electricity
through wire (or any material that allows charged particles to flow)
is very similar, in principle, to how water flows through pipes.  In
fact, to understand the basic components of electricity – voltage,
current and resistance – we’re going to use water flowing through
pipes as our analogy.</P>
<P><B>Voltage:</B></P>
<P>Voltage is the
difference in the amount of charge from one point in a circuit to
another.  An important concept of electricity is that charge can only
flow between two points that have a different amount of charge. 
Specifically, electricity likes to flow from a point of higher charge
to a point of lower charge.  If there is the same amount of charge at
two points in a circuit, no electricity will flow.</P>
<P>Using our water
analogy, voltage is equivalent to the amount of pressure there is
pushing water through a pipe.  Imagine a water pipe where the amount
of water pressure on one side of the pipe was equivalent to the
amount of water pressure on the other side of the pipe:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m1a88b3b3.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=131 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Because the pressure
on either side of the pipe is the same, water isn’t going to flow. 
Electricity works the same way – if the amount of charge (measured
in Volts) is the same on both sides of a circuit, electricity will
not flow.  The greater the voltage difference between two points in a
circuit, the “harder” electricity will flow through the circuit.</P>
<P>Before we go any
further, let’s take a quick look at how a battery works.  In a
battery, there are two “terminals” – a positive terminal and a
negative terminal.  The positive terminal contains a lot of
positively charged particles and the negative terminal contains a lot
of negatively charged particles:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m69e7ef1a.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=590 HEIGHT=170 BORDER=0></P>
<P>There is a barrier
between the two terminals which keeps the positively charged
particles and the negatively charged particles from mixing together. 
But, because there is a big charge differential between the two
terminals, if that barrier wasn’t there, the charge would quickly
flow from one side of the battery to the other (remember, it’s that
charge differential that causes electricity to flow).</P>
<P>Take a look at this
electric circuit made up of two equal sized batteries with a wire
running between them:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_5defaaf3.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=161 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Because the charge
(voltage) on both side of the wire is exactly the same, there is no
flow of electric charge (no flow of electricity).  But what happens
if we create a charge differential on the opposite sides of the wire:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_36311abf.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=145 BORDER=0></P>
<P>In this case, we
have a difference in charge (voltage) on either side of the wire, so
electricity will flow through the wire if we do this.  In fact, we
don’t even need the second battery in this example.  Electricity
would flow just as well if we connected a wire to a single battery,
like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_3b280f49.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=495 HEIGHT=161 BORDER=0></P>
<P>And, in fact, this
is what a typical battery-operated electronic circuit will look like
before you insert various components into the circuit loop.  We could
easily insert a lightbulb into the circuit above and you would see
the lightbulb illuminate:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m184d94fb.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=574 HEIGHT=396 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Keep this particular
circuit in mind, as we’ll be coming back to it often over the next
few projects.</P>
<P><B>Current:</B></P>
<P>Current is a measure
of the amount of electricity that flows through a circuit.  Using our
water analogy, if voltage is the amount of water pressure in a pipe,
current is the amount of water actually flowing through the pipe.</P>
<P>Take a look at these
two water pipes:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_68411fab.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=229 BORDER=0></P>
<P>Each pipe has the
same amount of pressure pushing the water through, but notice that
the second pipe is smaller than the first.  Because the second pipe
is smaller, less water will flow through it, despite having the same
amount of pressure.  
</P>
<P>What if we wanted to
get the same amount of water through the second pipe as the first,
but we couldn’t change the size of the pipes?  The obvious solution
would be to increase the water pressure in the second pipe:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_6e799d37.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=256 BORDER=0></P>
<P>In an electric
circuit, this would be equivalent to having to increase the amount of
voltage (charge differential) in the circuit in order to get the same
amount of electricity (charge) to flow.</P>
<P>But, what does it
mean to have a “smaller pipe” in a circuit?  That’s where
“resistance” comes in…</P>
<P><B>Resistance:</B></P>
<P>If voltage is
analogous to the amount of water pressure in a pipe, and current is
analogous to the amount of water actually moving through the pipe,
then resistance is analogous to the size of the pipe being used.  The
smaller the pipe, the harder you have to push to get the same amount
of water through the pipe.  In a circuit, that equates to the higher
the resistance of the circuit, the more voltage you need to generate
the same amount of current.</P>
<P>But, in a circuit,
wires are generally the same size.  So, you might be wondering --
what causes different amounts of resistance in an electric circuit?</P>
<P>The answer is that
lots of things can impact the resistance of a circuit, including the
material through which the electricity is flowing and the resistance
of the components being used.  As an example, different types of wire
will have different levels of resistance, which will ultimately
impact the current and voltage levels within the circuit.  And some
mediums – like air – have a nearly infinite resistance, meaning
electricity won’t flow through it at all.  In addition, there are
lots of times where we need to add resistance to a circuit (using
things called “resistors”) in order to get the circuit to act in
the way we want.</P>
<H3>Ground</H3>
<P>…</P>
<H3>Open Circuits, Short Circuits &amp; Resistive
Circuits</H3>
<P>In general, at any
given time, a circuit may be in one of three states:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Open Circuit – An open
	circuit is one that is not complete, and therefore electricity can’t
	flow.  As just mentioned, electricity isn’t able to flow through
	air, so if a circuit is not complete, the electrical current is
	experiencing infinite resistance at some point in the circuit and
	circuit will not function. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">   
</P>
<OL START=2>
	<LI><P>Short Circuit – A short
	circuit is what happens when the beginning of the circuit (power) is
	attached to the end of the circuit (ground) with nothing in between.
	 As mentioned above, electricity can flow through wire with almost
	no resistance, so attaching a wire from power to ground with nothing
	in between will cause large amounts of electricity to flow through
	that wire.  This can dissipate your power source very quickly, or
	worst-case, the large flow of current can heat up the wire to the
	point where it breaks or causes a fire.  Sometimes, if an electrical
	component breaks, it can provide a short circuit within itself, so
	even circuits that don’t appear to be “shorted,” can be.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in"><BR><BR>
</P>
<OL START=3>
	<LI><P>Resistive Circuit – A
	resistive circuit is one where electricity is flowing (circuit is
	not open) and electricity is experiencing resistance from one or
	more components within the circuit (circuit is not shorted).  This
	is the goal of most functioning circuits. 
	</P>
</OL>
<H3>Some Basic Components</H3>
<P>…</P>
<H2>Your First Circuit</H2>
<P>Now that we’ve
spent a good bit of time talking about electricity and circuits,
let’s jump into a real-life example of building a circuit.  We’ve
provided all parts you will need to build this circuit as part of the
RaspberrySTEM kit, so follow along!</P>
<P>The purpose of this
circuit to power and illuminate a “light emitting diode (or “LED”
for short).  An LED a light source that looks and works a bit like a
lightbulb, so this circuit will work nearly identically to the
circuit pictured above with the battery and the lightbulb. 
</P>
<P>To build this
circuit, you’ll need the following components:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m455c5cf0.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=246 BORDER=0></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>
	3 Volt Battery 
	</P>
	<LI><P>
	100 Ohm Resistor 
	</P>
	<LI><P>
	Red LED 
	</P>
	<LI><P>
	Three Wires</P>
</OL>
<P>By the way, remember
how we mentioned earlier that sometimes we want to provide extra
resistance to a circuit to get it to work?  Notice that we have
included a resistor in this circuit – its job is to reduce the
amount of electricity (current) flowing through the circuit so that
the LED doesn’t burn out.</P>
<P>Okay, let’s give
this a try, step by step…</P>
<P><B>Step #1:</B> 
Connect the positive (+) side of the battery to one lead (the metal
part) of the resistor using one of the wires.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m65f16c76.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=270 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Step #2:</B> 
Connect the other lead of the resistor to the longer lead of the LED
using another wire.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_m70ac4f6e.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=239 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Step #3:</B> 
Connect the shorter lead of the LED to the negative (-) side of the
Battery using Wire.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20061115-2_html_7ea4d21c.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=735 HEIGHT=237 BORDER=0></P>
<P>At this point, the
LED should be lit, as you see in the picture above.</P>
<P>One point to note –
the wire is actually not completely necessary in this circuit.  While
it makes it much easier to connect the parts together, if I were to
connect the Battery directly to the Resistor lead, connect the other
Resistor lead directly to the LED and then connect the LED directly
back to the Battery, electricity will flow directly through all the
parts exactly the same as when we used the wire.</P>
<P>Here’s what this
would look like if I were to connect the components directly together
and then connect them directly to a battery (in this case, using a 9V
battery):</P>
