 <div class="section" id="intro">

  <p>In our previous projects, <a data-uid="gpoutp"></a> and <a data-uid=
  "button"></a>, we introduced the concept of controlling and monitoring the
  state of a component (LEDs and buttons) by using GPIOs as inputs/outputs. In the
  gaming world, this concept gets more useful — and interesting — as we add
  more components. Unfortunately, it can also get tricky to manage inputs from,
  and outputs to, lots of different components. Which is why it's important to
  learn how to use lists to manage sets of similar components. We will also
  often use loops along with those lists to efficiently handle the information
  flowing to and from those components.</p>

  <p>In this project, we're going to wire four buttons to four different GPIOs.
  Based on the projects we've already done, it shouldn't be too difficult to
  create the circuit. But, then we're going to handle the input from those
  buttons using a list, instead of trying to manage input from each button
  individually. While this project will focus on buttons, the concept of
  monitoring inputs and controlling outputs using lists and loops can be
  applied to pretty much any component.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

 <p>Wiring four buttons to four different GPIOs is no different than wiring a
 single button to a GPIO and then replicating that circuit four times. Give it
 a try!</p>

 <p>Here are three things to remember as you're wiring your buttons:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>

   <p>The unconnected sides of each button should sit on different connect
   strips</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>One side of each button should be wired to ground</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>One side of each button should be wired to your chosen GPIO</p>
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>Here is what your breadboard should look like at this point (we've chosen
 to use GPIO14, GPIO15, GPIO25 and GPIO12 for our buttons):</p><img class="bb"

 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>For this project, we're simply going to create a list of buttons and then
  use a <code>for</code> loop to cycle through the list and determine which
  buttons are current being pressed.</p>

  <p>Here is what that code will look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
import time

my_buttons = [Button(14), Button(15), Button(25), Button(12)]

while True: 
    for button in my_buttons: 
        if button.is_pressed():
            print("Button connected to GPIO", button.pin, "is pressed")
    time.sleep(0.1)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's look at this code in more detail:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 1 and 2, we import the modules and functions we need</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 4, we create a list called <code>buttons</code> that contains the
    initialization for each of the four buttons we've created. For each button
    in the list, we call the Button() function, which returns a "button object"
    for each item in the <code>my_buttons</code> variable. We talked about that
    a bit in <a data-uid="vars"></a>, but the important thing to understand is
    that we can use these objects to access <code>Button()</code> functions and
    attributes</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 6, we start a loop (this is where we'll spend all of our time
    once we run the program)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 7, we create a <code>for</code> loop that we use to cycle
    through the items in the <code>my_buttons</code> list</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 8, we check to see if the next <code>button</code> in our list
    is currently being pressed</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 9, if the <code>button</code> we observed on Line 8 was being
    pressed, we send that information to the Program Output window</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Lines 7-9 will loop for each of the buttons in the list
    <code>my_buttons</code></p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 10, we pause briefly (so we don't hog the processor) and then
    return to the top of the <code>while</code> loop to check our buttons
    again</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>By using lists and loops, we've reduced the amount of code required to
  create and test four buttons from about 20 lines of code down to about 6
  lines of code!</p>

  <p>While that might not seem significant, imagine if you were creating
  something with dozens or hundreds of buttons (like a piano keyboard that has
  88 keys)? The code to monitor the 88 keys on a piano keyboard would be no
  longer than the code you see above. When you run this code, you'll see that
  every time you press a button, that information is sent to the Program Output
  window.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Write a little game to see how fast you can push a single button ten
    times. You'll need to keep a count of how many times the loop runs, and a
    count of how many times the button was pressed. Once the button is pressed
    10 times, break out of the loop, and print the count.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Write a little game to see how fast you can push all of the buttons, one
    at a time. You'll need to keep a count of how many times the loop runs, and
    then keep track of whether each button is pressed. Once they are all
    pressed, break out of the loop, and print the count.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Try replacing the four buttons above with four LEDs (make sure to wire
    them correctly as GPIO outputs), and then see if you can change the code to
    flash each of the LEDs one at a time using a list structure.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p> With four LEDs added, each one next to a button, light just
    one specific LED. Then, if a button next to that LED is pressed within half
    a second, the user wins. Have another player try to hit the correct button
    when you press start. This is the beginnings of <span class=
    "nospell">Whac-A-Mole</span> style amusement park game.</p>
