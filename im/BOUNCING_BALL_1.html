  <p>In this project, we're going to expand on what we did in the 
  previous concept, <a data-uid="gameloops"></a>, where we created 
  a simple "game" that moves a dot across the LED Matrix display.</p>

  <p>For this project, we're going to modify the game loop to test the location
  of the dot. When it reaches the edge of the display, we will reverse
  direction of the dot so that it never falls off the screen.</p>

  <p>Here's a reminder of what the code should look like so far:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
# Initialize the game environment
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (0, 0)

while True:
    # Get user input

    # Update the game world
    x += 1

    # Draw graphics on the screen
    fb.erase()
    fb.point(x, y)
    fb.show()

    # Wait for some period of time
    time.sleep(.5)

# Finish &amp; Cleanup
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>Your breadboard should still have the circuit we wired in the <a data-uid=
  "ledp"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it should look like:
  <img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>In the previous code, to move the dot to the right on the LED Matrix display, 
  we increment (increase) <code>x</code> by 1. This works
  great...until we get to the edge of the screen and we don't want to go any
  further. At that point, we're going to want the dot to move in the OPPOSITE
  direction (in this case, to the left). To do that, instead of incrementing
  <code>x</code> by 1, we're going to want to decrement (decrease)
  <code>x</code> by 1.</p>

  <p>In other words, to go to the right, we increase <code>x</code> by 1. 
  To go to the left, we decrease <code>x</code> by 1 â€” this is actually 
  the same as increasing <code>x</code> by -1.</p>

  <p>We can do this by creating a variable (let's call it
  <code>direction</code>), setting that variable to either 1 or -1 (depending
  on the direction we want the dot to go) and then increasing <code>x</code> by
  that variable. When <code>direction</code> is set to 1, the ball will move
  right; when <code>direction</code> is set to -1, the ball will move left.</p>

  <p>And, if we change the <code>direction</code> every time we get to the edge
  of the display (that is, when <code>x</code> gets to either 0 or 7), the dot
  will reverse direction.</p>

  <p>This requires the following changes to the code (marked with arrows):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

# Initialize the game environment
fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (0, 0)
*direction = 1

while True:
    # Get user input

    # Update the game world
*    x += direction
*    if (x &lt;= 0) or (x &gt;= 7):
*        direction = -direction

    # Draw graphics on the screen
    fb.erase()
    fb.point(x, y)
    fb.show()

    # Wait for some period of time
    time.sleep(.5)

# Finish &amp; Cleanup
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Give it a try. You should now see the dot bouncing back and forth on the
  display.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Can you make the ball bounce vertically instead of horizontally?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you make the ball bounce diagonally from the lower left corner (0,0)
    to the upper right corner (7,7)?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you have the ball start bouncing back forth slowly (as it does now),
    but continually get faster each time it hits a wall?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>In the example, the ball bounces all the way from the left side of the
    display to the right side. Can you confine the ball to only bounce on the
    left half of the screen?</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
