  <h1>Voltage, Current &amp; Resistance</h1>

  <p>In our <a data-uid="electronics"></a> concept earlier in this guide, we
  talked about three common measurements used in electrical circuit &mdash;
  <i>voltage</i>, <i>current</i> and <i>resistance</i>. These three things
  aren't just measurements; they actually define how, when and to what extent
  electric charge flows, and by controlling these three parts of a circuit, we
  can harness the power that electricity provides. While we can’t actually see
  voltage, current or resistance, there are some analogies we can use (based on
  the water analogy) to help understand what each of these concepts are and how
  they interact with each other.</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at a new circuit and an analogous water loop:</p>

  <p><mark>PIC: Battery resistive circuit vs water resistive circuit</mark></p>

  <p>Similar to our previous water analogy example, the battery (or pump)
  forces charged particles (or water molecules) around a closed circuit (or
  closed loop). But, in this example, we've added a narrowing to the pipe so we
  can discuss concepts relating to the circuit. Here is are the analogous
  pieces of each of the images above:</p>

   </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Now let's talk about each of these components in more detail...</p>
  <h2>Voltage</h2><mark>PIC: Battery vs water circuits, with low/high
  voltage/pressure highlighted</mark>

  <p>Voltage is electrical force and it's measured as the difference in the
  amount of charge from one point in an electrical circuit to another. An
  important electrical concept is that electrical current will typically only
  flow between two points that have a difference in charge (a voltage).
  Specifically, current will flow from a point of higher charge to a point of
  lower charge. If there is the same amount of charge at two points in a
  circuit, no electric charge will flow.</p>

  <p>Using our water analogy, voltage is analogous to the amount of pressure
  (basically, the force) that is pushing water through the pipe. In a circuit
  of pipes where water is being pushed, water enters the pump at a low pressure
  and is forced out of the pump at a high pressure. It is this pressure
  difference that makes the water flow. Likewise, in an electric circuit, a
  power source takes in charge at a low voltage and pushes it out at a high
  voltage. It is this difference in voltage on the opposite sides of the power
  source that makes the charged particles flow.</p>

  <p>One more thing to mention &mdash; voltage is almost always talked about as a
  measurement between two points. That is, voltage isn't an absolute value; it
  is relative to other points in a circuit. Think of it this way &mdash; we can say
  that it is 60 degrees outside (that's an absolute value), but we can also say
  that it's 20 degrees warmer inside than outside (though it's not clear what
  the exact inside and outside temperatures are). With voltage, we're always
  measuring relative to some other point in the circuit.</p>

  <p>For example, when we talk about the voltage of a battery, we're actually
  measuring the difference in charge between the positive side of the battery
  and the negative side. Sometimes we talk about a voltage at a single point &mdash; 
  in that case, it's generally assumed that we are measuring the voltage between 
  that point in the circuit and <i>ground</i>, which is the lowest point of charge 
  in a circuit.</p>

  <p>Voltage is measured in "volts", which are named after the Italian
  physicist Alessandro Volta, who was one of the first inventors of a
  rudimentary battery around 1800.</p>
  <h2>Current</h2><mark>PIC: Battery vs water circuits, with constant current
  highlighted</mark>

  <p>Current is the flow of electric charge through a circuit and it's measured
  as the amount of charged particles moving through a point in the circuit in a
  given period of time. Using our water analogy, current is analogous to the
  volume of water actually flowing through the pipe.</p>

  <p>It's important to note that in our simple circuit example above, the
  current is exactly the same at every point in the circuit. That is, at any
  point in the circuit, the same number of charged particles are passing that
  point in a given period of time. This is true for all the components of the
  circuit &mdash; current will move through the battery, the wires, and the resistor
  all at the same rate.</p>

  <p>If you think about the water analogy, you might realize that this must be
  true. If there was any segment of the circuit where there was more water
  continuouslly going into that segment than going out, then the pipe would
  ballon up at that point, and maybe even burst. But that doesn't happen &mdash;
  current flows around the entire circuit all together, in lock step.</p>

  <p>Current is measured in "amperes" ("amps", for short), which are named
  after the French physicist André-Marie Ampère, who researched electrical
  current and other phenomenon in the 1800s.</p>
  <div class="info">

    Negative current?
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Benjamin Franklin is generally credited with defining the "positive" and
    "negative" values of charge (which come from protons and electrons within
    atoms). Unfortunately, he did so more than 200 years before the discovery
    of atoms, so he didn't know what charge physically was; in fact, he refered
    to it as "electrical fluid".</p>

    <p>It turns out, you can understand many of the concepts of electricity
    without knowing the details of the physical particles that carry charge. In
    fact, you can think of electrical current as positive charges that flow in
    one direction, or you can think of it as negative charges that flow the
    opposite direction &mdash; from the outside, everything would look the same.</p>

    <p>Franklin made the arbitrary choice to define current as the flow of
    positive charges from a positive voltage to a negative voltage. However, we
    now know that the particles that actually move are negatively charged
    electrons, and they flow from negative to positive voltage. Today, we still
    draw current as moving from higher voltage (the positive terminal of a
    battery) to lower voltage (the negative terminal of a battery), but if you
    could see into a wire, you'd actually see that the electrons are moving in
    the opposite direction. We call the current flow from higher voltage to
    lower voltage <i>conventional current</i>.</p>

    <p>When you hear an engineers, teacher or electrician say "current", they
    most likely mean conventional current &mdash; not the actual flow of
    electrons.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Resistance</h2><mark>PIC: Labelled water/pump/narrowing resistance
  circuit</mark>

  <p>Resistance is what reduces the flow of current in a circuit. Using our
  water analogy, if a water pipe is constricted (narrowed), then less water can
  flow through it using the same amount of force. If you've ever played with a
  garden hose, this concept is probably familiar to you &mdash; if you pinch the
  hose, less water comes out. If you pinch the hose hard enough, <i>no</i>
  water comes out.</p>

  <p>As you might imagine from the water analogy, the more you increase
  resistance in an electrical circuit, the more you reduce the current moving
  through the circuit. All components in an electrical circuit will have some
  resistance &mdash; even the wires. But, some components have more resistance than
  others, and some components (resistors) are designed specifically for the purpose
  of creating resistance in a circuit. They are generally used to reduce
  current through part or all of the circuit.</p>

  <p>While introducing a resistor into a closed circuit will reduce current
  throughout the entire circuit (remember that current is going to be the same
  at every point in the circuit), a resistor will have a different voltage on
  one side of it than on the other. The voltage at the side of the resistor
  nearest the positive side of the power source will have a higher voltage than
  the side of the resistor nearest the negative (ground) side of the power
  source.</p>

  <p>This difference in voltage is called the <i>voltage drop</i> across the
  resistor. This is similar in the water analogy &mdash; when water is forced
  through a narrow pipe, the water gets "squished" together at the beginning of
  the narrow portion of pipe (pressure is higher) and is "unsquished" at the
  end of that portion of pipe (pressure is lower).</p>

  <p>Resistance is measured in "ohms", which are named after physicist Georg
  Simon Ohm, who studied electrical resistance in the 1800s.</p>

   <div>

    <p>You can't tell how much resistance a resistor has by the size of it. One
    resistor that is exactly the same size and shape as another can have a
    million or more times as much resistance. Because of this, some resistors
    are labelled with a color code &mdash; a set of colored bands that indicate what
    the value of the resistance, in ohms. The color code matches a color with
    each of the digits 0-9:</p>

    <p>As shown above, the first 2 bands of color are the first two digits of
    the resistance. The third band is a multiplier &mdash; it is the number of zeros
    to add to the end of the number.</p>

    <p>For example, for the resistor shown above, the color bands are brown,
    black, and red, which corresponds to the numbers 1, 0, and 2. Therefore,
    the resistance is "10" followed by 2 zeros, which equates to <i>1000</i>

  <h1>Ohm's Law</h1>

  <p>Now that you have the basic definitions of voltage, current and
  resistance, you're ready for one of the fundamental equations in circuit
  theory, Ohm's Law:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; font-size: 150%;">
  <strong><i>Voltage</i></strong> = <strong><i>Current</i></strong> ·
  <strong><i>Resistance</i></strong></p>

  <p>This formula basically says that, within any part of a circuit, voltage, 
  current and resistance are all interrelated &mdash; if you change one or two 
  of them, it will impact the others.  Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>If you keep the amount of resistance the same, increasing/decreasing the
    voltage by some percentage will increase/decrease the current by the same
    percentage. This makes sense when you think about the water analogy with a
    constricted pipe &mdash; if you increase the water pressure some percentage, the
    water flow will increase by the same percentage. For example, if you pump
    water twice as hard through a constricted water pipe, twice as much water
    will flow.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>If you keep the amount of voltage the same, increasing/decreasing the
    resistance by some percentage will increase/decrease the current by the
    same percentage. This makes sense when you think about the water analogy
    again &mdash; if you pump the water with a constant amount of force, it 
	will flow through a bigger pipe (less resistance) faster than it will flow 
	through a smaller pipe (more resistance). In fact, water will flow twice 
	as fast through a pipe that is twice as big if the pump is applying the
	same amount of force.</p>
   </li>

    <!--Turning this into comment in case we ever want to add back concept of
	Voltage Drop:
	
   <li>
	<p>If you keep the amount of current the same, increasing/decreasing the
    resistance by some percentage will increase/decrease the voltage by the
    same percentage. Again, let's go back to the water analogy and a
    constricted pipe &mdash; the water flow coming into the beginning of the pipe
    (where it is squished) will have a higher pressure than the water exiting
    the pipe at the unsquished end. Likewise, any component in an electrical
    circuit will have a higher voltage at the point where the current is coming
    in than it will at the point where the current is leaving the component.
    This is called the <i>voltage drop</i> across the component, and a
    component with twice as much resistance will have twice as big a voltage
    drop.</p>
   </li>
   -->
  </ul>

  <p>In our next project, we'll be modifying some simple circuits to test these
  properties of Ohm's Law.
