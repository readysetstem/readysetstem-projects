<H1>STRING THEORY</H1>
<P>Now that we’ve
successfully created a circuit and were able to control that circuit
through code, we’re well on our way to doing some really cool
stuff.  But, before we go much further, we need to spend the next
couple projects learning some basic coding concepts.</P>
<P>First, let’s talk
about “strings.”  When we talk about strings in programming,
we’re generally just talking about text.  For example, in our very
first project, we printed out the text “Hello, World!”  In this
example, “Hello, World!” is a string.</P>
<P>In fact, a string is
any combination of letters, numbers and symbols that is used as text,
and we typically indicate something is a string by putting quotation
marks (“”) around it.  Here are some examples of strings:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">‘Hello,
World!’</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">‘Four
score and seven years ago.’</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">‘4
score and 7 years ago.’</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">‘1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10’</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">‘My
name is Jason’</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">‘1+1’</P>
<P>While some of those
strings contain numbers and other symbols, because they are each
surrounded by quotation marks, we treat them as a single group of
characters, exactly as they are.  
</P>
<P>For example, you
might look at that last string (“1+1”) and think to yourself,
“That is the same as 2.”  While you’re obviously correct that
1+1 = 2, when the computer sees the quotation marks around that
string, it just thinks of it as a series of three characters put
together.</P>
<P>Just to verify this,
let’s revisit our program from Project #1 and replace the string
“Hello, World!” with these other strings.  While we could just
replace the “Hello, World!” string with another one in line 1 and
re-run the program, we can also just add additional lines below line
1 with our new commands.  Let’s take a look at how this would work…</P>
<H2>Step #1:  Enter Your Code in The Code Window</H2>
<P>Starting on line 2
of the Code Window, add the following lines (you can either type them
in or cut-and-paste as we described in Project #1):</P>
<P>print
(‘Hello, World!’)</P>
<P>print
(‘Four score and seven years ago.’)</P>
<P>print
(‘4 score and 7 years ago.’)</P>
<P>print
(‘1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10’)</P>
<P>print
(‘My name is Jason’)</P>
<P>print
(‘1+1’)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>When you are
finished, your code window should now look like this:</P>

<H2>Step #2:  Run Your Code</H2>
<P>Now that you’ve
entered all of your code into the Code Window, let’s see if it
works.  To run the program, click on the Play icon in the Icon menu.</P>
<H2>Step #3:  Verify the “Output” of Your Code</H2>
<P>If you’ve done
everything correctly, you should see the following in your Output
Window:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
