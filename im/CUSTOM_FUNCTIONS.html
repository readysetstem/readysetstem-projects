  <h1>User Defined Functions</h1>

  <p>In our earlier <a data-uid="functions"></a> tutorial, we discussed the concept
  of functions &mdash; specifically <i>built-in</i> functions, which are the functions
  and modules that <i>other people</i> have written to help you do lots of things in your
  code.  As you might recall, one big benefit to functions is that they allow you to
  reuse the same code over and over again, without having to type in all that code everywhere
  in your program that you need to use it.
  
  <p>In addition to built-in functions (those functions written by other people), Python
  and most other common programming languages allow you to create your own functions.  
  Creating your own functions has the same benefit of only needing to write code a single
  time, but it also allows you to customize the function to do whatever you want &mdash;
  as opposed to whatever someone else wants, as with built-in functions.
  
  <p>Here's an example of where custom functions are useful...</p>

  <p>Let's say that we wanted to write some code that would print my name and
  the year I was born. We could do this exactly like we did with the "Hello,
  World!" code we wrote in Project #1, and our code might look like the
  following:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
print('My name is: Jason')
print('I was born in: 1991')
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now let's say we expected to print those same lines many times within our
  code. While we could type those lines over and over again in the code, as you
  probably could guess, a simpler way would be to create a function that prints 
  those two lines, and then <i>call</i> that function every time we want those 
  lines printed. 
  
  <p>So, let's turn the above two lines into a function that we can call 
  from other places in our code...</p>

  <p>The first step in creating a function is giving it a name. In this case,
  let's say we wanted to call this function, "show_my_info". Here's how we'd
  create it:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
def show_my_info():
    print('My name is: Jason')
    print('I was born in: 1991')
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The keyword "def" stands for "define," as that's what we're doing &mdash;
  defining a new function. But, just like with built-in functions, the computer 
  won't run this code until the function is called.</p>

  <p>After the first line that names the function comes the code that we want
  our function to run every time it is called. In this case, it's the two print
  lines we discussed earlier.  Notice that all the code lines of the function are indented. This is
  required &mdash; just like with loops &mdash; so the code knows which lines are associated 
  with which function.</p>

  <p>To now use our function, we can call it elsewhere in our program, just like
  we do with built-in functions:</p>

  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
show_my_info()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's put it all together and write a program that defines this function
  and then calls this function to actually have it print out those two
  lines:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
def show_my_info():
    print('My name is: Jason')
    print('I was born in: 1991')

show_my_info()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, one big advantage of functions is that they allow us to reuse the same code
  over and over. So, let's see what happens when we call that function several
  times in a row:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
def show_my_info():
    print('My name is: Jason')
    print('I was born in: 1991')

show_my_info()
show_my_info()
show_my_info()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you run this program, you'll see that each of the three times the
  function is called, it prints the two lines. Imagine if we were going to need
  those two lines printed a hundred times throughout our program – you can see
  how using a function is a lot simpler and also makes our code much less
  complicated.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We mentioned earlier that when you run a program,
  the computer will execute each line of code, starting at the top and moving
  down through the code, line-by-line. But, when the computer sees a function,
  it doesn't execute that code until the function is called. So, for our code
  above, the first three lines (the function definition and the two lines of
  code in the function) are ignored and the computer will start by executing
  the first line below the function. To make things simpler, we can even store
  custom functions in separate files, just like built-in functions!</p>

  </div>
  
 <div class="section">
  <h1>FUNCTION INPUTS</h1>

  <p>Now that we have a basic idea of what a function is and how it works,
  let's talk about one of the more powerful aspects of using functions.
  Oftentimes, functions will contain code that we want to use over and over
  again, but we're going to want the code to do work slightly differently each
  time we use it.</p>

  <p>For example, when your cell phone rings, the software inside your phone is
  doing a lot of complicated stuff to generate the ring. Your phone has to
  "wake up," turn on the back light, print information on the display, check to
  see if you're pushing any buttons, play a ringtone, etc. In fact, the code
  that makes your cell phone ring may contain a hundred or more lines of
  code.</p>

  <p>When different friends call, you're going to see different information on
  your screen. For your friend John, you might see John's name, phone number
  and picture. For your friend Allison, you might see Allison's name, phone
  number and picture. Does this mean that the software has to have a hundred
  lines of code for John and a different hundred lines of code for Allison (as
  well as a different hundred lines of code every other person in your contact
  list)?</p>

  <p>Luckily, no...</p>

  <p>With functions, we have the ability to write generic tasks (like generate
  a ring), while also changing based on specific information (like putting
  different information on the screen for different callers). This is done by
  sending "inputs" (also called "parameters") to the function. Parameters are
  just pieces of information that the function uses to customize the task it is
  performing.  You saw that with built-in functions as well &mdash; remember
  how we pass GPIOs in our <code>Output()</code> and <code>Button</code> functions:</p>
  
    <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_led = Output(14)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's go back to our previous concept where we printed two pieces of
  information on the screen – my name (Jason) and the year I was born (1991).
  What if we wanted to print a name and birth year for other people as well –
  people with a different name and birth year than mine? To do this, we modify
  our function to receive parameters and to use those parameters to customize
  what the function does.</p>

  <p>In this example, our function is going to take two parameters:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>A name</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>A birth year</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>We tell the function what parameters to expect by listing them between the
  parentheses in the first line of the function (the line that names the
  function). Each parameter has its own name, which should be descriptive of
  what the parameter is.</p>

  <p>For example, if we wanted to modify our function from the previous project
  to take a name and birth year parameters, it might look like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
def show_my_info(name, birth_year):
    print('My name is: ', name)
    print('I was born in: ', birth_year)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>"name" and "birth_year" are now variables that we set when we call the
  function, and those variables can be used within that function:</p>

  <p>Now, when we call the show_my_info function, we will always supply two
  parameters to the function – a name and a year.</p>

  <p>For example, let's say we have a friend named Bob and he was born in 2005.
  We can send his information to the function like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
show_my_info('Bob', 2005)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Notice that we put quotation marks around "Bob" to make it a string (as
  you would expect), but we left the quotation marks off of 2005, making it a
  number instead of a string. While we could have put quotation marks around
  2005 to make it a string, we've decided to make it a number for reasons that
  will become clear later on.</p>

  <p>As another example, let's say we have a friend named Susie who was born in
  1999, and we want to print her information as well:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
show_my_info('Susie', 1999)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's put it all together, and see what our code would look like if
  we had this new function and we called this function twice – once to print
  Bob's information and once to print Susie's information:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
def show_my_info(name, birth_year):
    print('My name is: ', name)
    print('I was born in: ', birth_year)

show_my_info('Bob', 2005)
show_my_info('Susie', 1999)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>You may have noticed that this example is very similar to our cell phone
  example above. The software in a cell phone likely handles a ring by calling
  a function – the parameters of this function would be all the information
  that the function needs to correctly display the caller's information on the
  screen and make the phone ring. So, the parameters that are likely passed to
  the function would include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>Name of caller</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Phone number of caller</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Picture to be displayed for that caller</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Ring tone to be used for that caller</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Etc.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
</div>

 <div class="section">
  <h1>FUNCTION OUTPUTS</h1>

  <p>As you might suspect, not only can functions take inputs, they can
  also send information back (return output) to other parts of the code. A good
  example of this is when we have a function that does some calculations for
  us, and we want to get the results of those calculations.</p>

  <p>Perhaps instead of printing the name and birth year of people, we'd rather
  know how old the person will be on their birthday this year. Using the
  information we already have from our previous lesson, this calculation is
  pretty simple – we just subtract the birth year from the current year (2015
  as of this writing) and we'll get the age they will be turning this year.</p>

  <p>To create a new function to do this, we can still pass in the "birth_year"
  parameter for the person's birth year (like we did in the previous project)
  but, instead of printing the information, we do our age calculation and store
  the resulting value in a new variable called "age".</p>

  <p>This is what the function would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
def calculate_age(birth_year):
    age = 2016 - birth_year
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> When calling this function, it is required that the
  "birth_year" parameter is a number and not a string so that we can use it to
  perform this calculation.</p>

  <p>Now, to send the information we've calculated back to the main program, we
  end the function with a return statement that contains the information we're
  sending back (in this case, we're sending the information contained in the
  variable, "age"):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
def calculate_age(birth_year):
    age = 2016 - birth_year
    return age
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The value of "age" would then be returned to where the function was called
  and that value could be stored in another variable, printed or used however
  it is needed.</p>

  <p>For example, we could call this function for Bob and Susie like we did in
  the last project, but this time, we could get their age as well, store it in
  a variable and then print it out:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
bob_age = calculate_age(2005)
susie_age = calculate_age(1999)

print('This year, Bob will be ', bob_age)
print('This year, Susie will be ', susie_age)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is what the entire program would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
def calculate_age(birth_year):
    age = 2016 - birth_year
    return age

bob_age = calculate_age(2005)
susie_age = calculate_age(1999)

print('This year, Bob will be ', bob_age)
print('This year, Susie will be ', susie_age)
</textarea>
  </div>
</div>
