	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Welcome to the
	RaspberrySTEM Projects Guide!

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This guide is
	available both as part of your RaspberrySTEM IDE and on our website

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The goal of the
	RaspberrySTEM is to provide a step-by-step roadmap to learning the
	key principles of programming and electronics, and this guide is
	that roadmap.  Before we get started, here are a few notes and
	thoughts on how to make the best use this guide and the
	RaspberrySTEM kit:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">While youâre welcome to skip
		around this guide as you please, if you have no previous experience
		with programming or electronics, we recommend that you read and
		follow the projects in this guide in the order in which theyâre
		presented.  The guide is designed to build on itself, and skipping
		sections may make it difficult to fully understand later concepts
		and projects in the guide.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This guide is broken up into
		sections â some sections are labeled, âConceptsâ and some are
		labeled âProjects.â  The concepts are the important principles
		to learn prior to doing the Projects, and we have attempted to
		include the Concepts â¦</P>
	</UL>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Throughout the guide, we
		provide links to other resources that can be used to round out your
		understanding of the concepts being presented.</P>

	INTRODUCTION TO THE IDE</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">If youâre reading
	this, youâve successfully built your RaspberrySTEM, have connected
	it to the monitor and have loaded your Integrated Development
	Environment (IDE) â youâre now ready to get started!</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Here is (generally)
	what the IDE should look like:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_886f87a.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=665 HEIGHT=416 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The first thing
	youâll likely notice is that the screen is split down the middle,
	with the left side in blue and the right side in white (youâre
	probably reading this on the right-hand side of the screen right
	now).  The left (blue) side is also split into two pieces.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Below, weâll
	discuss each of these three sections of the IDE and how they work.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in; page-break-before: always">
	<B>Code Window</B></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Here is the window

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This is the Code
	Window and it consists of three parts:</P>

		<B>Icon Menu</B></P>
	</OL>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The Icon Menu
	consists of four clickable icons, each of which serves a specific
	function.  Letâs look at the four icons individually:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This is the âPlayâ

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This is the âFileâ
	icon.  When you click this icon, a list of files will pop up so that
	you can get back to code you have previously saved.  The popup will
	look like this:<IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_aa2ced4.png" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=14 WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=53 BORDER=0></P>

	above, you can see that the file being edited is called,
	âUnititled.pyâ  This is the default file when you first open the
	IDE, and the â.pyâ at the end of the filename denotes that the
	code stored in the file is written in the programming language
	Python.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Note that by

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Itâs customary in
	the programming world that the very first program you write is
	called, âHello, World!â  The purpose of this program is simple â
	have the computer print the words, âHello, World!â on the
	screen.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Weâre not ones to
	buck tradition, so weâre going to make âHello, World!â our

	easy to do (itâs only one line of code) and it will give us an
	opportunity to start exploring our Integrated Development
	Environment (IDE).</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Here are step-by-by
	instructions for implementing this project; after weâve completed
	it, weâll talk more about how and why it works.</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Step #1:  Find the Code Window on Your IDE</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">All the code you
	will be writing as part of the RaspberrySTEM projects will be done
	within the IDE.  Specifically, youâll be writing your code in the
	Code Window portion of the IDE, which we discussed in the User
	Guide.  As a reminder, here is the Code Window in the IDE:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_7992f68b.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=643 HEIGHT=402 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Youâll notice
	that at the top left corner of the Code Window, there is a line
	numbered â1â.  This is where you will type in your programâs
	code:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_88e55b8.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=624 HEIGHT=185 BORDER=0></P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Step #2:  Enter Your Code in The Code Window</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">On line 1 of the
	Code Window, type the following:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âHello, World!â)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">When you are
	finished typing that line, press &lt;ENTER&gt; and you should see a
	prompt for line 2 in your window.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Your code window
	should now look like this:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_524489da.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=636 HEIGHT=153 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Note:  </B>Itâs
	important to note that capitalization generally does matter when
	youâre programming.  In this line of code, if the word âprintâ
	isnât in all lowercase letters, you may find that your code
	doesnât work as expected.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Note: </B>
	Instead of typing that command, you can cut-and-paste it from right
	here in this document.  <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">To do
	that, highlight the line above using your mouseâ¦</SPAN></P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Step #3:  Run Your Code</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now that youâve
	typed (or cut-and-pasted) the line of code into the Code Window,
	letâs see if it works.  We do this by ârunningâ the program. 
	To run the program, click on the Play icon in the Icon menu
	(highlighted in Yellow here):</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_m18c278ea.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=626 HEIGHT=204 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Click the Play icon
	now.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The program runs by
	starting at the first line, doing what that line says (âexecutingâ
	that line), and then moving on to the next line.  It does that until
	it reaches the bottom.  In this case, we only have one line, so only
	that line of code is executed.</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Step #4:  Verify the âOutputâ of Your Code</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">If youâve done
	everything correctly, you should see the following in your Output
	Window (the window in the lower left of the IDE, below the Code
	Window):</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 107%">

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The first line of
	the output window is the result of the code youâve written â
	youâve successfully had the computer print the words âHello,
	World!â</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The second line
	indicates that the program is finished running â this will be
	important later when youâre writing longer and more complicated
	programs.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Congratulations! 
	Youâve just written your first program!</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>But wait!  What
	if the output from your program doesnât look like itâs supposed
	to?</B>  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This will happen
	when youâve made a mistake typing in your program. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Donât worry, this
	happens to all of us at some point or another â you may have made
	a little mistake (like misspelling a word) or you may have made a
	bigger mistake.  Luckily, with this first program, we should be able
	to figure out pretty easily where the mistake is.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Letâs discuss
	where the common mistakes might be in your program, and once you
	think you have them fixed, go ahead and click the Play icon again to
	have the computer run the program another time.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Common Mistake
	#1:  Capitalization is Important</B></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The most common
	mistake is not capitalize words in your program correctly.  In this
	case, the word âprintâ is a command word (it tells the computer
	to do something), and it needs to be all lowercase.  Verify that you
	havenât capitalized any of the letters in the word âprintâ. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Common Mistake
	#2:  Not Using Parentheses â â(â and â)â â Correctly</B></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">If youâve checked
	your capitalization and that wasnât the problem, next verify that
	you have parentheses around the âHello, World!â part of your
	code.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Common Mistake
	#3:  Not Using Quotation Marks (â â) â Correctly</B></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">If your
	capitalization is correct and youâve used the parentheses
	correctly, the next thing to check is that youâve correctly put
	quotation marks around âHello, World!â  It doesnât matter if
	youâve chosen to use single quotation marks (â) or double
	quotation marks (â), as long as you have the same on both sides.</P>

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In this project,
	youâre going to create your first electric circuit.  But, before
	we do that, some introductory discussion would probably be helpful. 
	Letâs talk about some of the basic of electricity, circuits and

	<H2 CLASS="western">INTRODUCTION TO CIRCUITS</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">While we donât
	intend this to be a complete textbook on electricity and circuits,
	there are some basic concepts you will want/need to understand to
	help you on your path of creating and programming electronics.  The
	information below should be enough to get you started, but as you
	gain some experience building circuits, youâll no doubt find that
	you have more questions and will be ready for more in-depth
	discussion of the topic.  <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">On our

	<H3 CLASS="western">What is a Circuit?</H3>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">A circuit is a
	closed loop that allows electricity to flow through it.  â¦</P>
	<H3 CLASS="western">Resistance &amp; Short Circuits</H3>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">As electricity is
	flowing through a circuit, it will encounter âresistance.â  When
	we talk about electrical resistance, itâs similar to the
	resistance you might feel while walking through various substances. 
		</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">For example, when
	walking around outside, you feel very little resistance.  But, when
	you walk through water (like when youâre in a pool), you feel a
	lot more resistance against your body.  Imagine how much resistance
	youâd feel walking through wet concrete.  And now imagine the
	âinfiniteâ amount of resistance youâd feel trying to walk
	through a brick wall.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Electricity will
	feel similar resistance when it attempts to flow through different
	components.  Electricity can flow through wires with very little
	resistance, but â except in rare situations â it canât flow
	through air.  When flowing through other things â like motors,
	light fixtures, etc. â electricity will experience different
	levels of resistance that will change the amount of energy that is
	flowing.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In general, any
	given circuit may be in one of three states:</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Open Circuit â An open
		circuit is one that is not complete, and therefore electricity
		canât flow.  As just mentioned, electricity isnât able to flow
		through air, so if a circuit is not complete, the electrical
		current is experiencing infinite resistance at some point in the
		circuit and circuit will not function.

		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Short Circuit â A short
		circuit is what happens when the beginning of the circuit (power)
		is attached to the end of the circuit (ground) with nothing in
		between.  As mentioned above, electricity can flow through wire
		with almost no resistance, so attaching a wire from power to ground
		with nothing in between will cause large amounts of electricity to
		flow through that wire.  This can dissipate your power source very
		quickly, or worst-case, the large flow of current can heat up the
		wire to the point where it breaks or causes a fire.  Sometimes, if
		an electrical component breaks, it can provide a short circuit
		within itself, so even circuits that donât appear to be
		âshorted,â can be.</P>

	negative (-) side.  And in some cases, youâll see a number next to
	a part indicating what size of that part to use â for example, a
	resistor may have something like â100 Î©â next to it, indicating
	that the resistor should be â100 ohmâ in size (weâll talk more
	about this later).</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Connecting the
	Parts</B></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In a schematic,
	youâll notice that all the parts are attached to each other by
	lines.  These lines represent the wires through which power in the
	circuit flow. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Wiring a circuit is
	as easy as attaching the wires to the parts (and to each other) as
	indicated in the schematic.  If you can replicate the drawing using
	real wires and parts, your circuit will work as expected. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Letâs use the
	following schematic as an example:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_m63cce344.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=474 HEIGHT=286 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Does this look
	familiar?  It should â this is a schematic of the circuit we build
	in the previous project.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">â¦</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Closing the Loop</B></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">You probably
	noticed in our schematic above that the entire circuit made a loop. 
	This makes sense given our definition of a circuit as needing to be
	a closed loop for it to work (remember, in an open circuit,
	electricity canât flow).  The electricity starts at the (+)
	terminal of the battery and finishes at the (-) terminal of the
	battery, also called the âground.â</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">All circuits will
	start at a power source and finish at the ground of that power
	source.  And in many schematics â like the one weâve been using
	above â the circuit will appear as a closed loop, starting at one
	side of the power source and completing at the other side.  And
	while this is how circuits work, itâs not always convenient to
	draw circuits in a closed loop.  Especially in complex schematics,
	where having to draw everything in a loop can make the drawings very
	difficult to read.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Which is why
	schematics will often separate the two sides of the power source,
	and make the schematic simpler to read.  Letâs take a look at how
	our schematic above would typically be drawn in the real world:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_3481aa80.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=97 HEIGHT=220 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">At the top of the
	schematic is the power source â indicated by the â9Vâ.  Just
	like in our previous schematic drawing, the power source is
	connected to the Resistor, which is then connected to the LED. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In this schematic
	diagram, the other lead of the LED doesnât loop back to the power
	source, but instead connects to a symbol that represents âground.â
	 In the real world, the circuit would connect back to the (-) side
	of the power source (which is ground), but in the diagram, the power
	and ground are separated to make the diagram simpler and easier to
	read.</P>

	PROJECT #4:  USING YOUR BREADBOARD</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	<BR>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Need
	a basic breadboard project for thisâ¦</SPAN></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In the previous
	sections, we talked about circuits, how they work and how we build
	them from their schematic diagram.  When it comes to building a
	circuit in real life, there are lots of ways to do it.  But, it
	generally boils down to either building a permanent circuit
	(involving soldering components together or wiring them together
	like we did in the last section) or building a temporary circuit
	(involving connecting components in an easily changeable way).  In
	most cases, youâll want to build temporary circuits in order to
	âplay aroundâ or to work out the kinks in your design; then,
	once you have a temporary circuit that is working exactly the way
	you want, you can use the design as the basis for your permanent
	circuit.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">One of the most
	common ways of building a temporary circuit involves the use of a
	âbreadboard,â which you may also hear referred to as a
	âproto-board.â  The name breadboard stems from the fact that
	early electronics hobbyists would often use the large wooden boards
	designed for rolling out and cutting bread dough to house their
	temporary circuits â here is an example:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The breadboards
	used to build electronics are often called âsolderlessâ
	breadboards, which can help avoid confusion when talking to your
	pastry chef friends.  ï</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="_Toc416357176"></A>Breadboard Design</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Breadboards come in
	many shapes and sizes, but the fundamental components of the
	breadboard will remain the same:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_m2bb8db12.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=487 HEIGHT=271 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Weâll get to the
	purpose of each of these parts in a moment, but the key to a
	breadboardâs usefulness is how the various areas are electrically
	connected.  Those connections are illustrated here:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_17c6d178.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=486 HEIGHT=269 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">As you can see,
	each of the two rails consists of two long row of connections (a red
	row in each rail and a blue row in each rail).  There are spaces
	between the groups of holes in the rail, but the entire row is still
	electrically connected as indicated.  Also note that the two red
	rows are not connected and the two blue rows are not connected â
	they are denoted in the same color only because they serve the same
	purpose.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In the center of
	the board, each row of five connect strips are electrically
	connected together.  While I only highlighted a few rows of connect
	strips, in actuality, every row of five is a connected strip.  Itâs
	important to note that there is no electrical connection across the
	notch â thereâs good reason for this which weâll get to in a
	bit.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">If you recall from
	our previous on basic electrical circuits, in order to have a closed
	circuit, electricity must be able to flow from power, through the
	circuit, to ground.  A breadboard makes it easy to wire a circuit in
	this fashion â the rails contain the start of the circuit (power)
	and the end of the circuit (ground), while the connect strips
	provide space for your components and the connections between those
	components.</P>

	PROJECT #6:  GENERAL PURPOSE I/O?</H1>
	<H2 CLASS="western">What Are GPIOs?</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Weâve discussed
	the RaspberrySTEM hardware platform and weâve talked a little bit
	about software and the RaspberrySTEM IDE.  But, youâre probably
	wondering how the hardware and the software work together to create
	physical circuits that can be controlled through software.  Thatâs
	where General Purpose Input/Outputs (GPIOs) come into play.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The purpose of
	GPIOs are like the nerve-system of the platform â their job is to
	relay information from the brain (the Raspberry Pi computer) to the
	muscles (the components of the circuit) and to take information from
	the muscles and relay it back to the brain.  GPIOs allow you to send
	data (information) to your circuit to tell it to do something
	specific and also allows your circuit to send data (information)
	back to the Raspberry Pi to be analyzed.</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Why Are GPIOs Useful?</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">To understand the
	power of GPIOs, letâs look at an exampleâ¦</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">We could use the
	RaspberrySTEM to create a âtemperature alarmâ that would serve a
	simple purpose â if the temperature dropped below a certain
	temperature threshold (or rose above a certain temperature
	threshold), an alarm would sound.  You can imagine something like
	this could be useful in a babyâs bedroom or a floristâs nursery.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This circuit would
	basically just consist of a temperature sensor that could read the
	room temperature and a speaker that could play the alarm sound.  In
	reality, this would actually be implemented as two separate circuits
	and there would likely be some additional supporting components, but
	for the sake of this example, we can keep things simple.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The software that
	weâd want to write to implement the temperature alarm would
	essentially do two things:</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Get temperature data from the
		temperature sensor; and</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Initiate an alarm if the
		temperature is outside the acceptable range.</P>
	</OL>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In this example,
	notice that the software has two main jobs â getting data (the
	temperature) from the circuit and sending data (when to sound the
	alarm) to the circuit.  How does it do this?  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Thatâs where the
	GPIOs come inâ¦</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The temperature
	sensor would be hooked up to one GPIO, which would be configured
	(through software) to send data from the circuit to the Raspberry
	Pi.  We would typically refer to this GPIO as an âinput,â as
	itâs bringing data in to the computer.  The speaker would be
	hooked up to another GPIO, which would be configured to send data
	from the Raspberry Pi to the circuit.  We would typically refer to
	this GPIO as an âoutput,â as itâs sending data out from the
	computer.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Using the GPIOs,
	the software running on the Raspberry Pi could ask the temperature
	sensor for a temperature reading and return that temperature to the
	Raspberry Pi software.  If the software gets a reading thatâs
	outside of the acceptable range, the software would then use the
	GPIO hooked to the speaker circuit to send a signal that would
	result in a sound being played on the speaker. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">As you can see,
	GPIOs are the connection between the software and the circuit; in
	fact, we can think of GPIOs as our interface between the computer
	and the physical world.  Using GPIOs, we can get information about
	whatâs going on in the physical environment and we can send data
	to the circuit to make adjustments to our components as necessary.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now that you have a
	conceptual idea of how a GPIO works, letâs put use one of the
	GPIOs on the RaspberrySTEM to provide some control of our circuit
	from our software.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In Project #0, we
	powered the LED circuit we created by hooking up power from the
	Raspberry Pi to the power strip on the breadboard through a pin that
	provided constant 3.3V of power.  Because that pin is always
	powered, the circuit is always receiving power and the LED is always
	lit.  To demonstrate the usefulness of GPIOs, weâre going to
	modify that project by hooking the circuit up to a GPIO instead of
	to the constant power source â the GPIO will only provide power
	when told to do so by the software, so we will be able to control
	the power to the LED circuit using the GPOI.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">There are two parts
	to this project â reconfiguring the hardware and implementing the
	software.  Letâs look at them separately:</P>
	<H3 CLASS="western">Project #1:  Configuring the Hardware</H3>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Starting with the

	PROJECT #7:  BASIC STRING THEORY</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now that weâve
	successfully created a circuit and were able to control that circuit
	through code, weâre well on our way to doing some really cool
	stuff.  But, before we go much further, we need to spend the next
	couple projects learning some basic coding concepts.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">First, letâs talk
	about âstrings.â  When we talk about strings in programming,
	weâre generally just talking about text.  For example, in our very
	first project, we printed out the text âHello, World!â  In this
	example, âHello, World!â is a string.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In fact, a string
	is any combination of letters, numbers and symbols that is used as
	text, and we typically indicate something is a string by putting
	quotation marks (ââ) around it.  Here are some examples of
	strings:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	â<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">Hello, World!â</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	â<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">Four score and seven years ago.â</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	â<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">4 score and 7 years ago.â</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	â<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10â</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	â<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">My name is Jasonâ</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	â<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">1+1â</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">While some of those
	strings contain numbers and other symbols, because they are each
	surrounded by quotation marks, we treat them as a single group of
	characters, exactly as they are.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">For example, you
	might look at that last string (â1+1â) and think to yourself,
	âThat is the same as 2.â  While youâre obviously correct that
	1+1 = 2, when the computer sees the quotation marks around that
	string, it just thinks of it as a series of three characters put
	together.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Just to verify
	this, letâs revisit our program from Project #1 and replace the
	string âHello, World!â with these other strings.  While we could
	just replace the âHello, World!â string with another one in line
	1 and re-run the program, we can also just add additional lines
	below line 1 with our new commands.  Letâs take a look at how this
	would workâ¦</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Step #1:  Enter Your Code in The Code Window</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Starting on line 2

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">While understanding

	PROJECT #9:  VARIABLES / ASSIGNMENTS</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Variables are one
	of the most important concepts in programming, and you will almost
	certainly be using them in every useful program you ever write. 
	Using variables makes it easier to write your code, to change your
	code later and to help others understand your code (which is
	important when writing code in groups).  Variables also are
	essential for keeping track of all the facts and figures you use
	throughout your code.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">VARIABLES
	GET ASSIGNED A VALUE â VARIABLE ON LEFT, VALUE/EXPRESSION ON RIGHT</SPAN></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The information
	that a variable holds could be a number, a phrase, a calculation, a
	list of information or pretty much anything you want that variable
	to hold.  
	</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Variables Can Hold Numbers</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">For example, in the
	previous project, we calculated the number of seconds in a day by
	multiplying the number of seconds in a minute by the number of
	minutes in an hour by the number of hours in a day.  I we wanted, we
	could rewrite that calculation to use variables instead.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Letâs start by
	creating a variable called âsec_in_minuteâ that will hold the
	number of seconds in a minute (which is 60):</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">sec_in_minute

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Note:</B>  When
	naming variables, you can use any combination of uppercase letters,
	lowercase letters, numbers and underscore characters (_).  The only
	rule is that the variable name must start with a letter.  Itâs
	good practice to use variable names that make your code easier to
	understand and read.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now, letâs create
	two more variables:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">min_in_hour

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Itâs probably

	is the number of minutes there are in an hour and <FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">hour_in_day</FONT>
	is the number of hours in a day.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">We could now change
	the code we did to do our calculation of number of seconds in a day
	to the following:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">They would very

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Also, while it
	seems like weâve made our code longer and more complicated, weâve
	now made it easier to use our calculations to do additional
	calculations if we wanted to.  For example, letâs say we wanted to
	calculate the number of seconds in a month or a year?  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Using the code
	weâve already written, it would be easy to add these calculations.
	 To determine the number of seconds in a month (assuming a 30 day
	month), we can just multiply the number of seconds in a day by 30 â
	and we can give the result its own variable:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">sec_in_month = sec_in_day * 30 </FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">To determine the
	number of seconds in a year, we can multiply the number of seconds
	in a day by 365:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">sec_in_year = sec_in_day * 365 </FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">As you can see, but
	using variables to hold our first calculations, we make it easier to
	do additional calculations.  And, if weâre working on a team or in
	a group, the entire program is easier for others to follow and
	understand.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Letâs put this
	all together, and create a program that will calculate the number of
	seconds in a day, month and year, and print out the results:</P>

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">The
	real benefit is that variables can change throughout a programâ¦</SPAN></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The final benefit
	of using variables is that, if a variable needs to change, we can
	change it in one place as opposed to having to change it in lots of
	different places.  For example, if scientists decided tomorrow that
	there should actually be 61 seconds in a minute, we could change our
	first line of code to:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">sec_in_minute = 61 </FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">And all of our code
	would now continue to make accurate calculations.  If we wouldnât
	have used variables, we would have had to go through our code and
	change every instance of 60 to 61 where we were referring to the
	number of seconds in a minute.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Of course, we donât
	expect the number of seconds in a minute to change, but there are
	plenty of things in this world that do change, and being able to
	update your programs quickly and easily when things change is a huge
	benefit to programmers.</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Variables Can Hold Strings</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In addition to
	holding numbers and calculations, variables can also hold strings. 
	For example, we could have a variable that holds one of the output
	message weâre using above:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 107%">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">message = âNumber of seconds in a
	day: â</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 107%"><BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">We could then print
	that message to the output, along with our calculation:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 107%">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (message, sec_in_day)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 107%"><BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Here is what the
	code and output would look like using a variable for the text
	string:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><IMG SRC="Projects%20Guide%20-%20060915_html_70568b2c.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=612 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Note that because
	message is now a variable, we donât put quotation marks around it.</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western">Variables Can Hold Lists of Information</H2>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Another common use
	of variables is to hold lists of information.  These can be lists of
	pretty much any type of information, though the two most common
	types of lists youâll likely be using are lists of strings and
	lists of numbers.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">An example of a
	list of strings would be a list containing the names of the months
	of the year.  To keep things simple, letâs just create a list
	containing the first five months; weâll use a variable called
	âmonthsâ:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">months = [âJanuaryâ, âFebruaryâ,
	âMarchâ, âAprilâ, âMayâ]</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Notice how the
	entire list has brackets [ ] around it and how each of the items in
	the list are strings with quotation marks around them.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now letâs look at
	some of the things we can do with that listâ¦</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">We can reference the entire
		list.  For example, letâs say we wanted to print the whole thing
		out:</P>
	</UL>

	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">We can reference a single item

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	Wait!  I said we were going to print out the third item on the list,
	and then I had it print <FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">months[2]</FONT>
	â thatâs not a typo.  Computers always start counting lists at
	0, not 1.  So, the first item on a list is [0], the second item on a
	list is [1] and so on.  To get the third item on the item, we
	reference it as [2].</P>

	PROJECT #10:  FUNCTIONS</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In this project
	weâre going to learn about functions.  A function is one of the
	most basic concepts in programming, and also one of the most
	important.  It often takes a lot of code to get a computer to do
	even a simple task.  And if you want the computer to do a simple
	task over and over again, that could mean having to write lots of
	code over and over again.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">That doesnât
	sound very efficient, does it?  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Itâs not, which
	is why instead of writing the same code many times, we just write
	the code once in a special format, and then we can use that code
	over and over again, as many times as we want.  That special format
	that allows us to re-use the code over and over again is called a
	function.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Hereâs an
	exampleâ¦</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Letâs say that we
	wanted to write some code that would print my name and the year I
	was born.  We could do this exactly like we did with the âHello,
	World!â code we wrote in Project #1, and our code might look like
	the following:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âMy name is:  Jasonâ)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âI was born in:  1971â)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now letâs say we
	expected to print those same lines many times within our code. 
	While we could type those lines over and over again in the code,
	that would â¦</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The simpler way
	would be to create a function that prints those two lines, and then
	âcallâ the function every time we want those lines printed. 
	Letâs turn the above two lines into a function that we can call
	from other places in our code.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The first step in
	creating a function is giving it a name.  In this case, letâs say
	we wanted to call this function, âprint_infoâ.  This is done by
	using the âdefâ keyword on the first line of the function,
	followed by the function name, a set of parentheses and a colon:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">def print_info ( ):</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">After the first
	line that names the function comes the code that we want our
	function to run every time it is called.  In this case, itâs the
	two print lines we discussed earlier.  So, this is what our function
	would look like:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">def print_info ( ):</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âMy name is:  Jasonâ)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âI was born in:  1971â)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Notice that all the
	code lines of the function are indented.  This is required, and is
	how the code knows which lines are associated with which function.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">To now use that
	function, we can call it elsewhere in our code like this:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print_info ( )</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">All we have to do
	to call the function is to provide the function name followed by a
	set of parentheses.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Letâs put it all
	together and write a program that defines this function and then
	calls this function to actually have it print out those two lines:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">def print_info ( ):</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âMy name is:  Jasonâ)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âI was born in:  1971â)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print_info ( )</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">One big value in
	functions is that it allows us to reuse the same code over and over.
	 So, letâs see what happens when we call that function several
	times in a row:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">If you run this
	program, youâll see that each of the three times the function is
	called, it prints the two lines.  Imagine if we were going to need
	those two lines printed a hundred times throughout our program â
	you can see how using a function is a lot simpler and also makes our
	code much less complicated.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Note: </B> We
	mentioned earlier that when you run a program, the computer will
	execute each line of code, starting at the top and moving down
	through the code, line-by-line.  But, when the computer sees a
	function, it doesnât execute that code until the function is
	called.  So, for our code above, the first three lines (the function
	definition and the two lines of code in the function) are ignored
	and the computer will start by executing the first line below the
	function.  To make things simpler, functions are often stored in
	separate files, so that the code is easier to read and follow.</P>

	PROJECT #11:  FUNCTION INPUTS</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Oftentimes,
	functions will contain code that we want to use over and over again,
	but weâre going to want the code to do slightly different things
	based on other things going on in our software.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">For example, when
	your cell phone rings, the software inside your phone is doing a lot
	of complicated stuff to generate the ring.  Your phone has to âwake
	up,â turn on the back light, print information on the display,
	check to see if youâre pushing any buttons, play ringtone, etc. 
	In fact, the code that makes your cell phone ring may contain a
	hundred or more lines of code.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">When different
	friends call, youâre going to see different information on your
	screen.  For your friend John, you might see Johnâs name, phone
	number and picture.  For your friend Allison, you might see
	Allisonâs name, phone number and picture.  Does this mean that the
	software has to have a hundred lines of code for John and a
	different hundred lines of code for Allison (as well as a different
	hundred lines of code every other person in your contact list)?  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Luckily, noâ¦</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">With functions, we
	have the ability to do generic tasks (like generate a ring), while
	also changing based on specific information (like putting different
	information on the screen for different callers).  This is done by
	sending âinputsâ (also called âparametersâ) to the function.
	 Parameters are just pieces of information that the function uses to
	customize the task it is performing.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Letâs go back to
	our previous project where we printed two pieces of information on
	the screen â my name (Jason) and the year I was born (1971).  What
	if we wanted to print a name and birth year for other people as well
	â people with a different name and birth year than mine?  To do
	this, we modify our function to receive parameters and to use those
	parameters to customize what the function does.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In this example,
	our function is going to take two parameters:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">A name</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">A birth year</P>
	</UL>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">We tell the
	function what parameters to expect by listing them between the
	parentheses in the first line of the function (the line that names
	the function).  Each parameter has its own name, which should be
	descriptive of what the parameter is.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">For example, if we
	wanted to modify our function from the previous project to take a
	name and a birth year parameters, it might look like this:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">def print_info (name, birth_year):</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">ânameâ and
	âyearâ are now variables that we set when we call the function,
	and those variables can be used within that function.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âMy name is:  %sâ % name)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print (âI was born in:  %sâ %
	birth_year)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now, when we call
	the print_info function, we will always supply two parameters to the
	function â a name and a year.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">For example, letâs
	say we have a friend named Bob and he was born in 1992.  We can sent
	his information to the function like this:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print_info (âBobâ, 1992)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Notice that we put
	quotation marks around âBobâ to make it a string (as you would
	expect), but we left the quotation marks off of 1992, making it a
	number instead of a string.  While we could have put quotation marks
	around 1992 to make it a string, Iâve decided to make it a number
	for reasons that will become clear later on.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">As another example,
	letâs say we have a friend named Susie who was born in 1985, and
	we want to print her information as well:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">print_info (âSusieâ, 1985)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now, letâs put it
	all together, and see what our code would look like if we had this
	new function and we called this function twice â once to print
	Bobâs information and once to print Susieâs information:</P>

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">You may have
	noticed that this example is very similar to our cell phone example
	above.  The software in a cell phone likely handles a ring by
	calling a function â the parameters to this function would be all
	the information that the function needs to correctly display the
	callerâs information on the screen and make the phone ring.  So,
	the parameters that likely get sent to the function would include:</P>
	<UL>

	PROJECT #12:  FUNCTION OUTPUTS</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">In the previous
	project, we talked about how functions can take inputs to allow them
	to do customized tasks.  But, not only can functions take inputs,
	they can also send information back (return output) to other parts
	of the code.  A good example of this is when we have a function that
	does some calculations for us, and we want to get the results of
	those calculations.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Perhaps instead of
	printing the name and birth year of people, weâd rather know how
	old the person will be on their birthday this year.  Using the
	information we already have from our previous project, this
	calculation is pretty simple â we just subtract the birth year
	from the current year (2015 as of this writing) and weâll get the
	age they will be turning this year.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">To create a new
	function to do this, we can still pass in the âyearâ parameter
	for the personâs birth year (like we did in the previous project)
	but, instead of printing the information, we do our age calculation
	and store the resulting value in a new variable called âageâ.  
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">This is what the
	function would look like:</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">def calculate_age (birth_year):</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">age = 2015 - year</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in"><B>Note:  </B>This
	is the reason we decided to keep the âyearâ parameter as a
	number instead of a string, so that we could use it to perform this
	calculation.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">Now, to send the
	information weâve calculated back to the main program, we end the
	function with a return statement that contains the information weâre
	sending back (in this case, weâre sending the information
	contained in the variable, âageâ):</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.25in">
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, serif">def calculate_age (birth_year):</FONT></P>

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">The value of âageâ
	would then be returned to where the function was called and that
	value could be stored in another variable, printed or used however
	it is needed.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.25in">For example, we
	could call this function for Bob and Susie like we did in the last
	project, but this time, we could get their age as well, store it in
