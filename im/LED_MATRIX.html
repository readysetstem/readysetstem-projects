  <h1>The LED Matrix</h1>

  <p>In this concept, we're going to introduce a new component that can be used
  for a variety of purposes, including building games. It's called an LED
  Matrix, and like the name implies, it is basically a small device that
  contains lots of little LEDs (64 of them, to be exact). This is what an LED
  Matrix looks like (though yours won't have the smiley face just yet and the
  writing you see on the image below is actually on the green circuit board,
  not the display):</p><img style="width: 276px" src="img/led.jpg" alt="">

  <p>An LED Matrix is the building block of large changing display signs that
  you see &mdash; as billboards, at sports stadiums, restaurants, and businesses. The
  idea is simple &mdash; if you can control one LED, then you can control many. And,
  if you can turn them on and off in a coordinated way, then you can make many
  LEDs together appear to work like a TV or computer monitor, and display
  images, animations, and more.</p>

  <p>The LED Matrix included with the CREATOR Kit is a single color matrix,
  where each LED in the matrix works just like the LEDs we used in previous
  projects. There is only one LED Matrix in the CREATOR Kit, but the LED Matrix
  is designed so that it can be chained together with more LED Matrixes to
  create larger displays.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Mounting the LED Matrix</h1>

  <p>Included with the CREATOR Kit is a bag labeled, <strong>LED Matrix Ready
  Set STEM Cell</strong>. This bag contains all the parts that you'll need to
  build and program the LED Matrix. In that bag you should find the
  following:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p><strong>LED Matrix:</strong> This actually consists of two parts that
    we've assembled for you &mdash; the green circuit board on the bottom and the
    LED display on the top. You can pull the display from the circuit board,
    but do so carefully so that none of the pins bend or break.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>LED Matrix Cable:</strong> This cable consists of five wires,
    with connectors on each end. This is the cable that will be used to connect
    the LED Matrix to the breadboard.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Mounting Posts:</strong> These two small posts and screws will
    need to be attached to the LED Matrix to allow it to attach to the
    breadboard.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Installing the Mounting Posts</h2>

  <p>The LED Matrix comes with two small mounting posts and screws that are
  used to attach the LED Matrix to the breadboard. The mounting posts should be
  installed prior to using the LED Matrix. To install the mounting posts,
  follow these steps:</p>
  <h3 class="step">Remove the LED Display from the Circuit Board</h3>

  <p>The LED Matrix consists of two parts, connected together by 16 pins (8 on
  each side). To install the mounting posts, you will need to pull the top part
  (the LED display) from the bottom part (the circuit board). This is done by
  gripping the edges of the LED display gently in one hand, gripping the edges
  of the circuit board gently in the other hand and carefully separating the
  display from the board. Try to apply equal pressure all around the display to
  avoid bending or breaking any pins.</p>

  <p>Once the display is separated from the circuit board, set the display
  aside.</p>
  <h3 class="step">Attach the Mounting Posts to the Circuit Board</h3>

  <p>On the circuit board corners are four holes, two labeled "A" and two
  labeled "B". You can attach the mounting posts either in the "A" holes or the
  "B" holes, but you will want to ensure that both mounting posts are attached
  to holes with the same letter (either both in "A" or both in "B"). Attach the
  mounting posts, as shown below:</p><img style="width: 275px" src=
  "img/posts.jpg" alt="">

  <p>Tighten the mounting post screws by hand. It's not necessary, but you can
  also use a small screwdriver to tighten the screws.</p>
  <h3 class="step">Re-Attach the LED Display to the Circuit Board</h3>

  <p>Once the mounting posts are secured and tightened, you'll need to
  re-attach the LED display to the circuit board. Holding the circuit board in
  one hand and the LED display in the other, carefully align the 16 pins on the
  LED display with the 16 holes on the circuit board. Once the pins and holes
  are aligned, gently press the LED display into the circuit board, applying
  equal pressure around the display to avoid breaking pins.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a specific orientation for the LED display
  to be mounted on the circuit board. The serial number of the LED display
  should be on the same side as the words "MATRIX TOP" on the circuit board, as
  shown in the picture below:</p><img style="width: 275px" src="img/Matrix.jpg"
  alt="">

  <p>The LED Matrix will mount on the breadboard by pushing the mounting posts
  into the breadboard holes. Keep in mind that the LED Matrix doesn't connect
  to the breadboard electrically &mdash; meaning, it doesn't need to be attached to
  the breadboard to work. All of the signals going between the CREATOR Kit and
  the LED Matrix will be going over the LED Matrix cable, and not through the
  breadboard.</p>

  <p>Mount the LED Matrix somewhere near the top right of the breadboard, like
  this: <img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_unconnected_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Power On Self Test</h1>

  <p>The Power On Self Test is a built in sequence that the LED Matrix can go
  through to demonstrate that it is working. To use it, you'll first need to
  hook up a wire from the CE to ground, as shown (the wire will plug into the
  right side of the LED Matrix): <img class="bb" src=
  "img/LED_Matrix_with_ce_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>Then, attach the the LED Matrix Cable, and plug in the power and ground
  wires, as shown: <img class="bb" src=
  "img/LED_Matrix_with_ce_and_power_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>

  <p>When the LED Matrix powers on, it will go through a preprogrammed
  sequence:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>A vertical bar will sweep across the display.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>A horizontal bar will sweep across the display.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>A pattern will show all 16 "colors" that the display can produce. Each
    color is a different shade of red.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>A bar and some dots will briefly be displayed. This indicates the
    version of the LED Matrix.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>A pulsating rectangle will be displayed, and will continue to animate
    until the CE wire is removed.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can remove the CE wire now &mdash; and it won't be needed in all future
  projects.</p>
