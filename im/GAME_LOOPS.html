  <h1>Overview</h1>

  <p>In this project, we introduce the concept of Game Loops, and we use a game
  loop to create a very basic game for the LED Matrix display.</p>

  <p>Now that we have the LED Matrix as a display and can take input with
  buttons, there's no reason we can't start creating some simple games. But,
  before we do that, there are some basics of computer game programming that
  are helpful to understand; in fact, once you get through this project, we'd
  be willing to bet that you have a new appreciation for how video games
  work.</p>

  <p>Most computer games (and especially those that most kids would consider to
  be video games) share a common method of programming called the "game loop."
  A game loop is a simple concept, but is the heart of most video games. The
  game loop essentially works by doing the same things over and over the entire
  time the game is running.</p>

  <p>We're going to explain game loops below using pseudo-code, which we
  discussed in more detail in our <a data-uid="simon0"></a> project.</p>

  <p>The pseudo-code for a typical game loop will look something like this:</p>
  <pre>
Initialize the game environment

while (game not finished):
    Check for user input
    Update the game world
    Draw graphics on the screen
    Wait for some period of time

Finish &amp; Cleanup
</pre>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>A Simple "Game"</h1>

  <p>We're going to create a simple "game" &mdash; too simple to really qualify as a
  game, but one that will give us start to creating more complicated games later.
  This game is going to draw a dot on the screen and move it across the screen
  from left to right. That's it &mdash; simple.</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
# Initialize the game environment
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (0, 0)

while True: 
    # Get user input 

    # Update the game world 
    x += 1 

    # Draw graphics on the screen 
    fb.erase() 
    fb.point(x, y) 
    fb.show() 

    # Wait for some period of time 
    time.sleep(.5)

# Finish &amp; Cleanup
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you have LED Matrix hooked up, you can give this a a try now!</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>How It Works</h1>

  <p>Lets examine the code line-by-line below.</p>
  <h2>Initialize the game environment</h2>

  <p>The very first step in any game is to initialize anything that will be
  used in the game loop. If you're not familiar with the term "initialize," it
  basically means setting up all the aspects of the game so that when the user
  starts playing, the game code is ready to be executed. For example, this
  might include creating a framebuffer that will hold the graphics during the
  game, defining the start location and speed of various game characters,
  etc.</p>

  <p>In most all Python programs, you'll start by importing the functions you're
  going to use in the program.</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="5">
   <textarea>
fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (0, 0)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In lines 5 and 6, we'll:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Create a framebuffer that we'll use to draw and display the dot</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Initialize the location of a dot when the loop starts (in this case,
    let's put the dot in the corner of the LED Matrix)</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>The game loop (while game is not finished)</h2>

  <p>We call it a game loop because it's an actual loop in the code that
  continues until the game is finished or until the user says chooses to exit.
  For this project, we're going to take the easy way out and just let the
  program run forever (until we stop the program). We can do this using a
  <code>while True:</code> loop.</p>

  <p>So, this will be the very first line of our game loop:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="8">
   <textarea>
while True:
    ...
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2>Check for user input</h2>

  <p>In a typical game loop, this is where we would check for user input &mdash;
  check for button presses, check for joystick movement, check for controller
  movement, etc. We'll do that in some subsequent projects, but for this
  particular project, we're keeping things simple and we're not taking any
  input from the user. So, there's no code to add for this part of the
  loop.</p>
  <h2>Update the game world</h2>

  <p>Updating the game world means taking the new information we have &mdash; either
  from the user input we've received or just because we are further along in
  time &mdash; and using this new information to update any parts of our game that
  now need to change. For example, in a character-based game, if a user has
  indicated that they want their character to move to the right side of the screen,
  the game world update might involve changing the location of the character,
  shifting the background, changing the location of other characters in the
  game, etc. This part of the game loop will figure out what the next set of
  graphics to display looks like in preparation to draw the new graphics.</p>

  <p>In our example, we're just going to automatically move the dot to the
  right one space, regardless of what the user does. To do that, we need to
  increment the x-coordinate by 1. We then erase the current framebuffer data
  and update the framebuffer with the new location.</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="12">
   <textarea>
x += 1
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2>Draw graphics on the screen</h2>

  <p>Once we have updated all the aspects of the game world and have the
  information about what will get displayed next, it's time to actually display
  the new graphics. This typically involves erasing and drawing the new
  graphics to the framebuffer and then displaying that framebuffer. We can do
  that just like we did in the last project:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="15">
   <textarea>
fb.erase()
fb.point(x, y)
fb.show()
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2>Wait for some period of time</h2>

  <p>The very last thing we often do in a game loop is to wait for some period
  of time. This (roughly) sets the rate at which the display gets updated. By
  setting the frame rate, we can know exactly how much to move graphics around
  the display from one frame to the next.</p>

  <p>Because our graphics will be updating each time through the loop, we'll
  want to choose a wait time that makes sense for our graphics updates.
  You'll probably want to play around with various pause times and see
  which works the best &mdash; too slow, and you might find that your program is not
  responsive; too fast, and you might find that the processor wastes power and
  causes poor performance of other programs running on the computer at the same
  time.</p>

  <p>In this case, our graphics rely on the loop speed, and we'd probably be
  happy moving the location of the dot every half-second, which means we'll
  want to put in a half-second delay at the end of the loop.</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="20">
   <textarea>
time.sleep(.5)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2>Finish &amp; Cleanup</h2>

  <p>At some point, the game will probably end and we'll drop out of the loop.
  This is most common when the player wins or loses a game, or when a player
  purposefully exits a game for some reason. When that happens, you may want to
  indicate to the user the final outcome of the game, play a separate set of
  graphics (for example, something special if the player beats the game) or you
  may want to go back to another menu screen.</p>

  <p>In this project, we never drop out of the loop (remember, we used a
  <code>while True:</code> loop), so there doesn't need to be any code at this
  point in the program.</p>
  <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

  <p>When you run this code, you should see the dot start at one corner of the
  LED Matrix and move in one direction until it is off the screen. Because
  we're not checking to see if the dot is still on the screen or not, the code
  will just continue to run even after you can no longer see the dot. So, once
  the dot has disappeared, you can stop the program.</p>

  <p>Also, you might notice that the first place you see the dot is at the LED
  second from the left. This is due to the fact that we "update the game world"
  before we "draw graphics on the screen." Our first update moves the dot one
  position to the right before we've even had a chance to see it on the
  screen. In a more normal game, this doesn't matter, as the wait period will
  be fast, and this small quirk won't be noticeable.</p>
