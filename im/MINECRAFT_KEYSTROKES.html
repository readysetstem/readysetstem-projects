  <h1>Controlling Our Character</h1>

  <p>As we mentioned earlier, the Ready Set STEM CREATOR Kit has an enhanced Minecraft API
  (<code>mcpi</code>) that allows us to control our Minecraft character (Steve)
  and manipulate the Minecraft world.  Normally, we move Steve around the Minecraft 
  world by pressing keys on the keyboard (for example, he moves forward when you press the "W"
  key).  One of the things the API allows us to do is to <i>simulate</i> keypresses &mdash; 
  that is, our program can make Minecraft <i>think</i> that the "W" key is being pressed, and 
  Steve will move forward exactly as if the key were actually pressed.
  
  <p>This functionality comes in handy when we want to control the movement of
  Steve when something happens &mdash; for example, when a button is pressed on the CREATOR Kit!</p>

  <p>Below, we'll discuss the major actions that our character can perform in the
  game, and how we can remap those actions to inputs other than the standard
  keyboard presses.</p>
  <h2>Control API</h2>

  <p>All of the character control functions are accessed from the
  <code>control</code> module, which we can import with:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import control
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Once the <code>control</code> module is imported, we can control Steve's movements
  with the functions <code>forward()</code>, <code>backward()</code>,
  <code>left()</code> and <code>right()</code>. Calling those functions without
  arguments is just like pressing and holding the keyboard key that normally
  invokes this movement. The "key" is not released until you call the function
  with the argument <code>release=True</code>.</p>

  <p>For example, to have Steve walk forward for two seconds and then stop, this
  is what the code would look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.forward()
time.sleep(2)
control.forward(release=True)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>This is what our code snippet does:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 1, we start moving Steve forward</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 2, we wait for two seconds (during which time Steve is continuously
    moving)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 3, we stop Steve's movement</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Another way to implement this same functionality (having a key pressed for
  a specific amount of time) is by using the <code>duration=</code> argument
  inside the function. Similar to above, the following code will have Steve 
  walk forward for two seconds and then stop:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.forward(duration=2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>This one line of code achieves the same functionality as the three lines of code
  above.</p>

  <p>Finally, to stop all keys from being pressed, you can use
  <code>control.stop()</code>. For example, to walk both forward and right for
  two seconds and then stop, our code might look like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.forward()
control.right()
time.sleep(2)
control.stop()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to controlling Steve's movement forward, backwards, left and
  right, we also have the ability to control his other actions.</p>

  <p>One of the main things that Steve does in Minecraft is break (smash)
  blocks. This is typically accomplished using the left mouse button. Using the
  same <code>control</code> module we've been using, we can have Steve smash
  whatever is in front of him using the following code:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.smash()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Additionally, Steve has the ability to jump (which is typically
  accomplished using the spacebar on the keyboard) and can be implemented in
  our code like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.jump()
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2>Current Keyboard/Mouse Mappings</h2>

  <p>Because the <code>control</code> functions simply poll the keyboard and
  mouse presses, there are many additional <code>control</code> commands that
  we can implement in our code â€” in fact, there is one for every keypress
  supported by Minecraft.</p>

   <table class="basic">
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <th>

       <p>KEY</p>
      </th>
      <th>

       <p>FUNCTION</p>
      </th>
     </tr>
     <tr> <td> <p>S</p> </td> <td> <p><code>backward()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>W</p> </td> <td> <p><code>forward()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>A</p> </td> <td> <p><code>left()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>D</p> </td> <td> <p><code>right()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>SPACE</p> </td> <td> <p><code>jump()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>SHIFT</p> </td> <td> <p><code>crouch()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>Left Mouse Click</p> </td> <td> <p><code>smash()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>Right Mouse Click</p> </td> <td> <p><code>place()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>Right Mouse Click</p> </td> <td> <p><code>hit()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>1..8 (choice)</p> </td> <td> <p><code>item(choice)</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>ENTER</p> </td> <td> <p><code>enter()</code></p> </td>
     <tr> <td> <p>E</p> </td> <td> <p><code>inventory()</code></p> </td>
    </tbody>
   </table>

  <h1>Look Out (And Around)</h1>

  <p>While simulating the keyboard keystrokes are important for moving Steve around, 
  to fully control Steve, we need to be able to simulate the mouse as well.  Mouse 
  movements make Steve look around, and you can simulate them with the control API function
  <code>look()</code>.

  <p>To use <code>look()</code> you need to provide an <i>amount</i> that you want to 
  move the mouse (and therefore Steve) left, right, up, and down.

  <p>For example, to turn Steve left a little bit, try:

  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.look(left=1)
</textarea>
  </div>
  
  <p>And, to look left a lot:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.look(left=100)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>You'll have to experiment to see what works best for you depending upon how you are trying
  to move Steve &mdash; 0 won't turn Steve at all, numbers close to 1 will turn him a little, and
  once you get somewhere between 100 and 1000, you'll end up turning him completely around.

 <p>Besides looking left, Steve can look up, down, and right as well.  For example, to have Steve 
 look far up, we can try:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.look(up=100)
</textarea>
  </div>
  We can also combine the actions of looking in different directions at the same time:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.look(left=100, up=100)
</textarea>
  </div>
Of course, looking in opposite directions (up and down or left and right) at the same time by 
the same amount won't do anything.  For example, this does nothing:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.look(up=300, down=300)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>Finally, negative values work, too!  A negative value for left is the same as a positive
  value for right; the same is true for up and down.  So, the following lines do exactly the
  same thing:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
control.look(up=-50)
control.look(down=50)
</textarea>
  </div>

 </div>
