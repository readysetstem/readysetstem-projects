  <p>In this project, we'll add sounds to our accelerometer shake game. With
  sounds, specifically text-to-speech like we used in the <a data-uid=
  "speechp"></a> project, we can command the user to do different actions
  through the game, and let them know if they've succeeded.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>You'll need to wire up the Accelerometer as done in previous projects.
  Here is what your breadboard should look like once the accelerometer is
  properly wired:</p>

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing...</p>

  <p>The bulk of the changes above are to add 3 new tilt methods: tile right,
  tilt up, and "shake me". After adding these, we'll now have a real game! For
  each new tilt type, we've duplicated the code that handles the left tilt, and
  changed the variable names and detection to handle right tilt, tilt up, and
  "shake me".</p>

  <p>The "shake me" detection is a little different, and needs so explanation.
  To correctly do a "shake" you must keep the CREATOR Kit level, and shake up
  and down. This is necessary — if we allowed the kit to be tiled while it was
  shaken, we wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a tilt and a
  shake.</p>

  <p>So to test for "shaking" we test to make sure that <code>x</code> is small
  (it's not tilted left or right) and that <code>y</code> is small (it's not
  tiled up or down). Then we check that <code>z</code> is far away from 1 (it's
  normal position). Remember: when the CREATOR Kit is sitting flat on a table,
  <code>z</code> will be 1 — it means that the force of the earth is pulling it
  down. When the kit is moved up quickly <code>z</code> will go a good bit
  higher than 1. When the kit is moved back down quickly <code>z</code> will go
  a good bit lower than 1.</p>

  <p>Besides testing for the new tilts, there are some other minor changes:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 34, we no longer always request <code>LEFT</code> tilt. Instead,
    we now randomly choose a tilt, from 1 to 4, which corresponds to
    <code>LEFT</code>, <code>RIGHT</code>, <code>UP</code>, or
    <code>SHAKE</code>.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 58, we change the period, after each time the user performs the
    correct action. This will make the game go faster and faster until it's
    crazy hard to respond with the correct action in time.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>The speaker is unamplified, and sounds are sometime hard to hear. Can
    you modify all of the sounds to have an overdriven volume? (Hint: see
    <a data-uid="tts"></a>)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you add a "tilt down" action that is the opposite of tilt up?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you keep a count of how many correct actions were performed
    correctly, and print out the number of correct actions once the game is
    over?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Instead of printing the number of correct action (from the last
    question), can you have the code say the number out loud? (Hint: you may
    need to create a new <code>Speech()</code> for each number you want to say
    — so you might need to limit the answer to numbers under, say, 10)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you add a sideways shake action (that is, shake left and right,
    while keeping the kit level)?</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
