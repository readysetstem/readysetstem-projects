  <h1>VARIABLES &amp; ASSIGNMENTS</h1>

  <p>Variables are one of the most important concepts in programming, and you
  will certainly be using them in every useful program you write. Variables are
  like labels, or names, for the numbers and values in your
  programs. Variables are used for keeping track of all the facts and figures
  you use throughout your code.</p>

  <p>Variables can be given any name you choose (although there are some rules
  to that!) Choosing good variable names makes it easier to write your code, to
  change your code later and to help others understand your code.</p>

  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Variable names
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Choosing good variable names can make a program easier to read an understand.  A variable
    can generally be any name you want, as long as it contains only:
    <ul><li><p>Uppercase (A through Z) or lowercase (a through z) letters</p></li>
    <li><p>Digits (0 through 9)</p></li>
    <li><p>The underscore character ("_")</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>And, it can't start with a digit, either.
    <p>So, for example:
    <table class="basic slim">
     <tbody class="thistable">
      <tr>
       <th>

        <p>Variable Name</p>
       </th>
       <th>

        <p>Allowed?</p>
       </th>
      </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>fred</span></td> <td> <p>YES</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>Fred</span></td> <td> <p>YES</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>FRED</span></td> <td> <p>YES</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>Fred.Schmed</span></td> <td> <p>NO &mdash; Can't use periods</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>this_is_a_really_long_variable_name</span></td> <td> <p>YES</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>thisisareallylongvariablenametoo</span></td> <td> <p>YES &mdash; but it sure is hard
      to read</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>Fred's_house</span></td> <td> <p>NO &mdash; Can't use apostrophe</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>Freds house</span></td> <td> <p>NO &mdash; Can't use spaces</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>Freds_house</span></td> <td> <p>YES</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>Fred123</span></td> <td> <p>YES</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>123Fred</span></td> <td> <p>NO &mdash; Can't start with a digit</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>You Don't Say?</span></td> <td> <p>NO &mdash; Can't use apostrophe or question mark</p> </td> </tr>
      <tr> <td> <p><span class=nospell>#firstworldproblems</span></td> <td> <p>NO &mdash; Can't use hash</p> </td> </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Even though you can name variables any way you want, it's common to
    write variable names that are longer than one word by separating the words
    with underscores.  And, that's the way we'll generally do it throughout this guide.  One
    exception: for variables that don't change values throughout the program, we'll
    generally use ALL_CAPS for those variable names.
   </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Assigning Values to Variables</h2>
  <p>The definition of "variable" is something that can vary (change), and
  that's what program variables do throughout a program. To assign a variable a
  value, you use the equals sign (=) in what is called an "assignment statement,"
  which looks like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_variable = 5
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>To change it to a different value, you use another assignment
  statement:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_variable = 7
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>A variable can be any type of value, including a number, a phrase, the
  results of a calculation, or a list.  The value of a variable
  can change any number of times in a program.</p>
  
  <h2>Variables Can Be Assigned Numbers</h2>

  <p>As an example, we'll calculate the number of seconds in a day. To do do
  this, we'll start by creating a variable called <code>sec_in_minute</code> that will be
  the number of seconds in a minute (which is 60):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
sec_in_minute = 60
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's create two more variables:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
min_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We can now compute (and print) the number of seconds in a day with:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print(sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The asterisk ('*') is a multiplication symbol &mdash; see the <a data-uid=
  "calc"></a> project for more information.</p>

  <p>Here is what the output would look like if you ran that code:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
86400
</pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Variables Can Be Assigned the Value of Other Variables</h2>

  <p>Remember we said above that variables can be almost any type of data â€“
  that includes data from other variables. We can take our program one step
  further by creating a variable called <code>sec_in_day</code> and using it to be our
  calculation for the number of seconds in a day:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
sec_in_day = sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, if you want to output the number of seconds in a day, you can simply
  print the number being held by the <code>sec_in_day</code> variable:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print(sec_in_day)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>This is what the output would look like:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
86400
</pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Variables Can Be Assigned Strings</h2>

  <p>Variables can also be "strings".   In programming, strings are just
  sequences of characters &mdash; generally normal text.  For example, we could
  have a variable that holds one of the output message we're using above:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
message = "Number of seconds in a day: "
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We could then print that message to the output, along with our
  calculation:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print(message, sec_in_day)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is what the code and output would look like using a variable for the
  text string:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
Number of seconds in a day: 86400
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Note that because message is now a variable, we don't put quotation marks
  around it.</p>

    Other Variable Types
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>In this tutorial, we've discussed two types of variable values: numbers and strings.  But there are
    many other types of data values that can be used as well:
    <ul>
    <li><p>Lists &mdash; Lists are ordered sequences of other values.  We'll discuss them more in
  <a data-uid="lists"></a> and will be using them frequently in future projects.  </p></li>
    <li><p><span class=nospell>Booleans</span> - <span
    class=nospell>Booleans</span> are a funny name for the values
    <code>True</code> and
    <code>False</code>.  We'll discuss them more in
  <a data-uid="if"></a> and you'll experience the concept of booleans lots of different places.  </p></li>
    <li><p>None &mdash; <code>None</code> is a special value which strangely indicates that there
    is no value at all.  </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Those are the most common types of values, and they cover the ones you'll see in the core set
    of Ready Set STEM projects.  But there are more, including types you can even define yourself.  By
	the way, in
    Python, as in some other programming languages, all values are called <i>objects</i>, and we'll 
	discuss objects more throughout this guide.
