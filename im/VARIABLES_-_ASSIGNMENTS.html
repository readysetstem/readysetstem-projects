  <h1>Variables &amp; Assignments</h1>

  <p>Variables are one of the most important concepts in programming, and you
  will certainly be using them in every useful program you write. Variables are
  like labels, or names, for the numbers and other values in your programs. Variables
  are used for keeping track of all the facts and figures you use throughout
  your code.</p>

  <p>Variables can be given any name you choose (although there are some rules
  to that!). Choosing good variable names makes it easier to write your code, to
  change your code later and to help others understand your code.</p>
  <div class="info">

    Variable names
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Choosing good variable names can make a program easier to read and
    understand. A variable can generally be any name you want, as long as it
    contains only:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>

      <p>Uppercase (A through Z) or lowercase (a through z) letters</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>Digits (0 through 9)</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>The underscore character ("_")</p>
     </li>
    </ul>

    <p>And, it can't start with a digit, either.</p>

    <p>So, for example:</p>
    <table class="basic slim">
     <tbody class="thistable">
      <tr>
       <th>

        <p>Variable Name</p>
       </th>
       <th>

        <p>Allowed?</p>
       </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>

        <p><span class="nospell">fred</span></p>

       <td>

        <p>YES</p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>

        <p><span class="nospell">Fred</span></p>

        <p>YES</p>
       </td>
      </tr>

      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Even though you can name variables any way you want, it's common to
    write variable names that are longer than one word by separating the words
    with underscores. That's the way we'll generally do it throughout this
    guide, with one exception: for variables that don't change values throughout the
    program, we'll generally use ALL_CAPS for those variable names.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Assigning Values to Variables</h2>

  <p>A "variable" is a value that can vary (change), and that's what program
  variables do throughout a program. To assign a variable a value, you use the
  equals sign (=) in what is called an "assignment statement," which looks
  like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_variable = 5
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>To change it to a different value, you use another assignment
  statement:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_variable = 7
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>A variable can be many different types of values, including numbers,
  phrases (called "strings"), 
  or lists. The value of a variable can change many times in a program.</p>
  <h2>Variables Can Be Assigned Numbers</h2>

  <p>As an example, we'll calculate the number of seconds in a day. To do
  this, we'll start by creating a variable called <code>sec_in_minute</code>
  that will be the number of seconds in a minute (which is 60):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
sec_in_minute = 60
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's create two more variables:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
min_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We can now compute (and print) the number of seconds in a day with:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print(sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The asterisk ('*') is a multiplication symbol — see the <a data-uid=
  "calc"></a> project for more information.</p>

  <p>Here is what the output would look like if you ran that code:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
86400
</pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Variables Can Be Assigned the Value of Other Variables</h2>

  <p>Remember we said above that variables can be almost any type of data –
  that includes data from other variables. We can take our program one step
  further by creating a variable called <code>sec_in_day</code> and using it to
  be our calculation for the number of seconds in a day:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
sec_in_day = sec_in_minute * min_in_hour * hour_in_day
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, if you want to output the number of seconds in a day, you can simply
  print the number being held by the <code>sec_in_day</code> variable:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print(sec_in_day)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>This is what the output would look like:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
86400
</pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Variables Can Be Assigned Strings</h2>

  <p>Variables can also be "strings". In programming, strings are just
  sequences of characters — generally normal text. For example, we could have a
  variable that holds one of the output message we're using above:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
message = "Number of seconds in a day: "
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We could then print that message to the output, along with our
  calculation:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
print(message, sec_in_day)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is what the code and output would look like using a variable for the
  text string:</p>
  <div class="output">
   <pre>
Number of seconds in a day: 86400
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Note that because <code>message</code> is a variable, we don't put quotation marks
  around it.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Other Variable Types
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>In this tutorial, we've discussed two types of variable values: numbers
    and strings. There are many other types of data values that can be used
    as well:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>

      <p>Lists — Lists are ordered sequences of other values. We'll discuss
      them more in <a data-uid="lists"></a> and will be using them frequently
      in future projects.</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p><span class="nospell">Booleans</span> - <span class=
      "nospell">Booleans</span> are a funny name for the values
      <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. We'll discuss them more in
      <a data-uid="if"></a> and you'll experience the concept of booleans lots
      of different places.</p>
     </li>
     <li>

      <p>None — <code>None</code> is a special value which appropriately indicates
      that there is no value at all.</p>
     </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Those are the most common types of values, and they cover the ones
    you'll see in the core set of Ready Set STEM projects. But there are more,
    including types you can even define yourself. </p>
    
    <p>One last note: in Python, as in
    some other programming languages, all values are called <i>objects</i>, and
    we'll discuss objects more throughout this guide.</p>
