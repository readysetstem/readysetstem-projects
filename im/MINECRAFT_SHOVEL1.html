 <div class="hw" data-count="1" data-name="button"></div>
 <div id="intro" class="section">

  <p>In previous Minecraft projects, we remapped the control functions that are
  typically handled by keyboard presses and implemented them in a custom
  controller that we built. In this project, we're going to start actually
  manipulating blocks in the Minecraft world.

  <p>In this specific project, we will learn how to monitor when Minecraft
  blocks have been "hit" and then gather and use that information in our
  code.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>For this project, we need just a single button mapped to GPIO24. You are
  welcome to keep the full hardware setup from a previous project that has a button
  attached to GPIO24, or you can simplify your hardware to the following:
  <img class="bb" src="img/Minecraft_1button_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>Here is the code that will allow us to get information about blocks that
  were hit and then print out information about those blocks.

  <p>You should recognize most of the code below, but we've highlighted the important
  code with red arrows:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control, block
import time

control.show()
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

button = Button(24)

while True:
*    if button.presses():
*        control.hit(duration=0.2)

*    hits = mc.events.pollBlockHits()

*    for hit in hits:
*        print("The X, Y, Z coordinates of the block you hit is:", hit.pos)

    time.sleep(0.01)

</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here's how the code works:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 11-12, we check to see if our button has been pressed. If so,
    we implement a "hit" — the equivalent of a right mouse click when holding
    the sword.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 14, we get a list of all hit events that have taken place since
    the last time we ran this function. We store that list of hits in a
    variable called <code>hits</code>. We talk about this function in more
    detail below.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 16-17, we implement a <code>for</code> that cycles through each
    hit event in our <code>hits</code> variable, and then prints out the
    coordinates (X, Y, Z) of each block that was hit since the last time we
    cycled through this function.</p>
   </li>

  </ul>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    mc.event.pollBlockHits()
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>In our code above, we used the function
    <code>mc.event.pollBlockHits()</code> to gather information about all the
    "events" that have taken place with all of the Minecraft blocks. 
    The Minecraft API only supports one "event" type, which is a block being
    hit, so this function will simply return a list of all blocks that have
    been hit since the last time this function was called.</p>

    <p>We can store that list of blocks that were hit in an object/variable (we
    use <code>hits</code> in our code above), and can then use that variable to
    gather information about those blocks or to act on them. The most common
    piece of information we will want to know about a block that was hit is the
    block's position, in X, Y and Z coordinates. This can be gathered using the
    <code>.pos</code> property of the object, as we saw in this line of code
    above: 
<pre>
print("The X, Y, Z coordinates of the block you hit is:", hit.pos)
</pre></p>

    <p>Specific coordinate positions can be determined as well. For example, we
    could replace the previous line of code with: 
    <pre>
print("The X coordinate of the block you hit is:", hit.pos.x)
print("The Y coordinate of the block you hit is:", hit.pos.y)
print("The Z coordinate of the block you hit is:", hit.pos.z)
</pre>
<p>(although the above code will print 3 lines instead of 1).
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Assuming you still have your controller wired up, add this shovel code to 
	the Minecraft controller code (<a data-uid="mccontr3"></a> project) to add 
	shovel functionality to one of your controller buttons.
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
     <p>The <code>pollBlockHits</code> function returns a list of new hits, and
     there can be more than one item in that list.  However, our game loop runs
     pretty fast, so you'll probably never see more than one hit in the list.
     Instead of printing the coordinates, just print out how many hits occurred
     <i>if there was more than one</i>.
     </p> </li> <li> <p>
     <p>If you completed the previous challenge, then try slowing the game loop
     down to see if you can create more than one new hit at a time.
   </p> </li>
