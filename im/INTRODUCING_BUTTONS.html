  <h1>Closed, Open &amp; Short Circuits</h1>

  <p>We have discussed several times throughout this guide that in order for a
  circuit to operate properly — for electric current to be able to flow — the
  circuit must be a closed loop. When we have a circuit that is a closed loop
  and where current is flowing, we call that a <i><b>closed circuit</b></i>. It
  is always our goal for our circuits to be closed circuits, so that they
  operate as we expect.</p>

  <p>When our circuit doesn't form a closed loop, we call that an
  <i><strong>open circuit</strong></i>. Actually, by definition, an open
  circuit is not a circuit at all, as electric charge can't flow around a loop
  that is broken. Very often when a circuit is not working as expected —
  especially when nothing at all seems to be happening with the circuit — the
  problem is that the circuit doesn't form a complete loop and is an open
  circuit.</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at the lightbulb circuit from <a data-uid=
  "electronics"></a>, and cut a wire — by doing this, we have created an open
  circuit, current will stop flowing and the light bulb will not
  illuminate:</p>

  <div class="info">
   <div>
    The Path of Least Resistance
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>An important concept behind electric current is that it will tend to
    favor paths of low resistance over paths of higher resistance. In other
    words, if your circuit has two potential paths for current to flow, and if
    one of those paths has less resistance than the other, more current will
    flow through the path with less resistance than through the path with more
    resistance.</p>
    <!-- TBD PIC: Parallel circuit - one path small resistor, one path large -->

    <p>That's not to say <i>all</i> the current will flow through the path of
    least resistance, but that <i>more</i> current will flow through that path.
    In fact, if a circuit has 10 paths for current to flow, current will flow
    through all 10 of those paths, but the paths with the least resistance will
    have the most current flowing through them and the paths with the highest
    resistance will have the least current flowing through them.</p>
    <!-- TBD PIC: Parallel circuit - Many paths, many resistances -->
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>While we always strive to have a closed circuit, not all closed circuits
  are going to work as we want or expect. One particular situation where a
  closed circuit will often not work correctly is when we have a
  <i><strong>short circuit</strong></i>.</p>

  <p>A short circuit is a closed circuit where one part of a circuit is
  <i>unintentionally</i> connected by a plain wire to another part of the
  circuit, and unintentionally bypasses a set of components. Electric charge
  can then flow through a part of the circuit that it was not intended to and
  unexpected things can happen.</p>

  <p>For example, let's say that we are trying to build a circuit that contains
  two lightbulbs:</p><img class="schematic" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-with-2-lightbulbs.png">

  <p>But, we accidentally add another wire that runs between the two
  lightbulbs:</p><img class="schematic" alt="" src=
  "img/Battery-with-2-lightbulbs-shorted.png">

  <p>In this case, current has two potential paths that it can follow once it
  gets past the first lightbulb — one path is through the second lightbulb and
  one path is directly to the negative terminal of the battery. We mentioned
  above that current will always flow down every path, but when one path has a
  <i>much lower</i> resistance than another path, nearly all the current will
  tend to flow down the path with the much lower resistance.</p>

  <p>A plain wire has almost no resistance. Therefore, almost all the current
  will flow through the bare wire — instead of through the second lightbulb —
  and the second lightbulb will not illuminate. Any time that you see your
  circuit not acting the way you would expect, check to ensure that there are
  no unintentional short circuits.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Shorting the Battery
   </div>
   <div>

   <p>There's one specific type of short circuit that we want to talk about a
   little more, as it's especially bad. Not only can it make your circuit not
   work as expected, but it can even cause damage to various components of your
   circuit. This situation occurs when you have a short circuit (a plain wire)
   that connects power to ground with nothing in-between.</p>

   <p>For example, this is one example of what shorting the battery might look
   like:</p><img class="schematic" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" src=
   "img/Battery-shorted.png">

   <p>Here is another example of shorting the battery:</p><img class=
   "schematic" alt="" src="img/Battery-with-lightbulb-shorted.png">

   <p>In that second example, we have a full circuit with a battery and
   lightbulb, and we also have a short that runs directly from the positive
   terminal of the battery to the negative terminal. Remember from earlier that
   if current has a choice between two paths, and one path has <i>much
   lower</i> resistance, most of the current will run through that path. In
   this case, most of the current will run from the positive terminal of the
   battery to the negative terminal, directly through the plain wire.</p>

   <p>The reason why shorting a battery is so bad is that when you have all the
   current running directly from the positive terminal of the battery to the
   negative terminal without any load (components) in-between, you will quickly
   drain your battery.</p>

   <p>But shorts don't apply just to batteries &mdash; you can accidentally
   short any power
   source. For
   example, here is what a short circuit might look like using our breadboard
   with the Raspberry Pi as the power source:</p><img class="bb" src=
   "img/Breadboard_short_bb.jpg" alt="">

   <p>In this circuit, we have a short directly from power to ground. Because
   we have a <i>lot</i> of current running from the Raspberry Pi power source
   directly back to the Raspberry Pi ground, we'll overload the Raspberry Pi
   electronic circuitry and the Raspberry Pi will likely shutdown.</p>

   <p><b>NOTE: If the Raspberry Pi ever shuts down or reboots while you are creating circuits,
   check to see if you have a short circuit on your breadboard.</b>
   This will often
   happen if you accidentally wire both power and ground into the same
   breadboard rail, like this:</p><img class="bb" src=
   "img/Breadboard_short_red_rail_bb.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Look closely at the power and ground connections in the above circuit &mdash; it's <b>NOT</b> a working circuit!</p>

  <h1>Pushing Your Buttons</h1>

  <p>One of the most common — and versatile — components in the electronics
  world is the pushbutton (or just "button"). A button is just a very simple
  switch — electric current can flow through it only when it is pressed, but
  can't flow through it when it is not pressed. </p>

  <p>Go ahead and take one of the buttons out of your <strong>Your First
  Circuit Ready Set STEM Cell</strong> bag, and let's take a closer look at how it
  works. This is a very basic pushbutton — it has four "legs" that can be
  attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit, and it has one button
  in the center of the device that can be pushed ("closed") or released
  ("open").</p>

  <p>When the button is left unpressed, the legs are not connected to one
  another. If that button is inserted into a circuit, the circuit is
  <i>open</i> when the button is unpressed. As we learned above, in an open
  circuit, current doesn't flow and the components don't do anything. When the
  button is pressed, a small metal disk inside of the button pushes into
  the legs of the button, connecting all four metal legs together — this
  <i>closes</i> the circuit (when the button is part of a circuit). Remember, when a circuit is closed, current will
  flow and the components in the circuit will operate.</p>

  <p>One thing to note: internally, the left side of the button (the two legs
  on the left) are connected together, and the right side of the button (the
  two legs on the right) are connected together:</p><img style="width: 150px;"
  alt="" src="img/button.png">

  <p>The dashed green lines above show the internal wires that permanently
  connect some of the legs together. So, when using a button, you'll generally
  want to just use two of the legs — either the top two, or the bottom two.</p>

  <p>As we mentioned above, when we insert a button into a circuit, it has one
  of two operations:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open circuit, no
    electric current can flow through the button and nothing happens.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and closes the
    circuit — electric current can then flow through the button and the
    rest of the circuit.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
