  <h1>Closed, Open &amp; Short Circuits</h1>

  <p>We have discussed several times throughout this guide that in order for a
  circuit to operate properly &mdash; for electric current to be able to flow &mdash; the
  circuit must be a closed loop. When we have a circuit that is a closed loop
  and where current is flowing, we call that a <i><b>closed circuit</b></i>. It
  is always our goal for our circuits to be closed circuits, so that they
  operate as we expect.</p>

  <p>When our circuit doesn't form a closed loop, we call that an
  <i><strong>open circuit</strong></i>. Actually, by definition, an open
  circuit is not a circuit at all, as electric charge can't flow around a loop
  that is broken. Very often when a circuit is not working as expected --
  especially when nothing at all seems to be happening with the circuit &mdash; the
  problem is that the circuit doesn't form a complete loop and is an open
  circuit.</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at the lightbulb circuit from <a data-uid=
  "electronics"></a>, and cut a wire &mdash; by doing this, we have created an open
  circuit, current will stop flowing and the light bulb will not
  illuminate:</p>

  <p><mark>MOVE THE FOLLOWING ABOUT SHORT CIRCUITS TO
  PARALLEL/SERIES???</mark></p>

  <div class="info">
   <div>
    <mark>The Path of Least Resistance</mark>
   </div>
   <div>

    <p><mark>An important concept behind electric current is that it will tend
    to favor paths of low resistance over paths of higher resistance. In other
    words, if your circuit has two potential paths for current to flow, and if
    one of those paths has less resistance than the other, more current will
    flow through the path with less resistance than through the path with more
    resistance.</mark></p>

    <p><mark><mark>PIC: Parallel circuit - one path small resistor, one path
    large</mark></mark></p>

    <p><mark>That's not to say <i>all</i> the current will flow through the
    path of least resistance, but that <i>more</i> current will flow through
    that path. In fact, if a circuit has 10 paths for current to flow, current
    will flow through all 10 of those paths, but the paths with the least
    resistance will have the most current flowing through them and the paths
    with the highest resistance will have the least current flowing through
    them.</mark></p>

    <p><mark><mark>PIC: Parallel circuit - Many paths, many
    resistances</mark></mark></p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p><mark>While we always strive to have a closed circuit, not all closed
  circuits are going to work as we want or expect. One particular situation
  where a closed circuit will often not work correctly is when we have a
  <i><strong>short circuit</strong></i>.</mark></p>

  <p><mark>A short circuit is a closed circuit where one part of a circuit is
  <i>unintentionally</i> connected by a plain wire to another part of the
  circuit, and unintentionally by-passes a set of components. Electric charge
  can then flow through a part of the circuit that it was not intended to, and
  unexpected things can happen.</mark></p>

  <p><mark>For example, let's say that we are trying to build a circuit that
  contains two lightbulbs:</mark></p>

  <p><mark><mark>SCHEMATIC: Two lightbulb circuit</mark></mark></p>

  <p><mark>But, we accidentally add another wire that runs between the two
  lightbulbs:</mark></p>

  <p><mark><mark>SCHEMATIC: Two lightbulb circuit with a short between the
  bulbs</mark></mark></p>

  <p><mark>In this case, current has two potential paths that it can follow
  once it gets past the first lightbulb &mdash; one path is through the second
  lightbulb and one path is directly to the negative terminal of the battery.
  We mentioned above that current will always flow down every path, but when
  one path has a <i>much lower</i> resistance than another path, nearly all the
  current will tend to flow down the path with the much lower
  resistance.</mark></p>

  <p><mark>A plain wire has almost no resistance. Therefore, almost all the
  current will flow through the bare wire &mdash; instead of through the second
  lightbulb &mdash; and the second lightbulb will not illuminate. Any time that you
  see your circuit not acting the way you would expect, check to ensure that
  there are no unintentional short circuits.</mark></p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    <mark>Shorting the Battery</mark>
   </div>
   <div>

    <p><mark>There's one specific type of short circuit that we want to talk
    about a little more, as it's especially bad. Not only can it make your
    circuit not work as expected, but it can even cause damage to various
    components of your circuit. This situation occurs when you have a short
    circuit (a plain wire) that connects power to ground with nothing
    in-between.</mark></p>

    <p><mark>For example, this is one example of what shorting the battery
    might look like:</mark></p>

    <p><mark><mark>SCHEMATIC: Battery with single wire from + to -</mark></mark></p>

    <p><mark>Here is another exmaple of shorting the battery:</mark></p>

    <p><mark><mark>SCHEMATIC: Battery with load (lightbulb) and also a short wire in
    parallel</mark></mark></p>

    <p><mark>In that second example, we have a full circuit with a battery and
    lightbulb, and we also have a short that runs directly from the positive
    terminal of the battery to the negative terminal. Remember from earlier
    that if current has a choice between two paths, and one path has much
    <i>much lower</i> resistance, most of the current will run through that
    path. In this case, most of the current will run from the positive terminal
    of the battery to the negative terminal, directly through the plain
    wire.</mark></p>

    <p><mark>The reason why shorting a battery is so bad is that when you have
    all the current running directly from the positive terminal of the battery
    to the negative terminal without any load (components) in-between, you will
    quickly drain your battery.</mark></p>

    <p><mark>Shorting the battery can actually work with any power source. For
    example, here is what a short circuit might look like using our breadboard
    with the Raspberry Pi as the power source:</mark></p>

    <p><mark><mark>PIC: Short on the breadboard</mark></mark></p>

    <p><mark>In this circuit, we have a short directly from power to ground.
    Because we have a <i>lot</i> of current running from the Raspberry Pi power
    source directly back to the Raspberry Pi ground, we'll overload the
    Raspberry Pi electronic circuitry and the Raspberry Pi will likely reboot
    itself.</mark></p>

    <p><mark><b>NOTE: If the Raspberry Pi ever reboots for no apparent reason,
    check to see if you have a short circuit on your breadboard.</b> This will
    often happen if you accidentally wire both power and ground into the same
    breadboard rail, like this:</mark></p>

    <p><mark><mark>PIC: 3.3V and GND both plugged into red
    rail</mark></mark></p>

  <h1><mark>Pushing Your Buttons</mark></h1>

  <p><mark>One of the most common &mdash; and versatile &mdash; components in the
  electronics world is the pushbutton (or just "button"). A button is just a
  very simple switch &mdash; electric current can flow through it only when it is
  pressed, but can't flow through it when it is not pressed. While buttons are
  very simple in the way they work, when you use them strategically in a
  circuit &mdash; and when you combine that circuit with some computer code &mdash;
  buttons can provide a very versatile way to get information from a user to a
  computer program.</mark></p>

  <p><mark>Go ahead and take one of the buttons out of your <strong>Your First
  Circuit Ready Set STEM Cell</strong>, and let's take a closer look at how it
  works. This is a very basic pushbutton &mdash; it has four "legs" that can be
  attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit, and it has one button
  in the center of the device that can be pushed ("closed") or released
  ("open").</mark></p>

  <p><mark>When the button is left unpressed, the legs are not connected to one
  another. If that button is inserted into a circuit, the circuit is
  <i>open</i> when the button is unpressed. As we learned above, in an open
  circuit, current doesn't flow and the components don't do anything. When the
  button is pressed, a small metal disk inside of the button case pushes into
  the legs of the button, connecting all four metal legs together &mdash; this
  <i>closes</i> the circuit. Remember, when a circuit is closed, current will
  flow and the components in the circuit will operate.</mark></p>

  <p><mark>On thing to note: Internally, the left side of the button (the two
  legs on the left) are connected together, and the right side of the button
  (the two legs on the right) are connected together:</mark></p>

  <p><mark><mark>Replace drawing below with button used in breadboard diagrams
  <img style="width: 202px;" alt="" src=
  "img/button2%20cropped.jpg"></mark></mark></p>

  <p><mark><mark>PIC: Animate above drawing to show current flowing on left and
  right???</mark></mark></p>

  <p><mark>The dashed lines above show the internal wires that permanently
  connect some of the legs together. So, when using a button, you'll generally
  want to just use two of the legs &mdash; either the top two, or the bottom
  two.</mark></p>

  <p><mark>As we mentioned above, when we insert a button into a circuit, it
  has one of two operations:</mark></p>
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p><mark>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open circuit, no
    electric current can flow through the button and nothing
    happens.</mark></p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><mark>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and closes
    the circuit &mdash; electric current can then flow through the button and the
    components can operate.</mark></p>
   </li>
  </ol>
