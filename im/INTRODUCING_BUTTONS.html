  <h1>Closed, Open & Short Circuits</h1>

  <p>We have discussed several times throughout this guide that in order for a
  circuit to operate properly -- for electric current to be able to flow -- the
  circuit must be a closed loop.  When we have a circuit that is a closed loop
  and where current is flowing, we call that a <i><b>closed circuit</b></i>. 
  It is always our goal for our circuits to be closed circuits, so that they
  operate as we expect.
  
  <p>When our circuit doesn't form a closed loop, we call that an 
  <i><strong>open circuit</strong></i>.  Actually, by definition, an open
  circuit is not a circuit at all, as electric charge can't flow around a loop 
  that is broken.  Very often when a circuit is not working as expected --
  especially when nothing at all seems to be happening with the circuit --
  the problem is that the circuit doesn't form a complete loop and is an
  open circuit.
  
  <p>Let's take a look at the lightbulb circuit from <a data-uid="electronics"></a>, 
  and cut a wire -- by doing this, we have created an open circuit, current will 
  stop flowing and the light bulb will not illuminate:

		 The Path of Least Resistance
    </div>
    <div>
  <p>An important concept behind electric current is that it will tend to favor
  paths of low resistance over paths of higher resistance.  In other words, if 
  your circuit has two potential paths for current to flow, and if one of those 
  paths has less resistance than the other, more current will flow through the 
  path with less resistance than through the path with more resistance.  

  <p><mark>PIC: Parallel circuit - one path small resistor, one path large
  
  <p>That's not to say <i>all</i> the current will flow through the path of least
  resistance, but that <i>more</i> current will flow through that path.  In fact,
  if a circuit has 10 paths for current to flow, current will flow through all
  10 of those paths, but the paths with the least resistance will have the most
  current flowing through them and the paths with the highest resistance will have
  the least current flowing through them.

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>

  <p>While we always strive to have a closed circuit, not all closed circuits
  are  going to work as we want or expect.  One particular situation where a 
  closed circuit will often not work correctly is when we have a 
  <i><strong>short circuit</strong></i>.  
  
  <p>A short circuit is a closed circuit where one part of a circuit is 
  <i>unintentionally</i> connected by a wire to another part of the circuit, and
  unintentionally by-passes a set of components.  Electric charge can then flow 
  through a part of the circuit that it was not intended to, and unexpected 
  things can happen.
  
  <p>For example, let's say that we are trying to build a circuit that contains 
  two lightbulbs:

  <p><mark>PIC: Two lightbulb circuit
  
  <p>But, we accidentally add another wire that runs between the two lightbulbs:
  
  <p><mark>PIC: Two lightbulb circuit with a short between the bulbs

  <p>In this case, current has two potential paths that it can follow once it
  gets past the first lightbulb -- one path is through the second lightbulb and 
  one path is directly to the negative terminal of the battery.  We mentioned
  above that current will always flow down every path, but when one path has
  a <i>much lower</i> resistance than another path, nearly all the current will
  tend to flow down the path with the much lower resistance.
  
  <p>A plain wire has almost no resistance.  Therefore, almost all the current
  will flow through the bare wire -- instead of through the second lightbulb --
  and the second lightbulb will not illuminate.  Any time that you see your 
  circuit not acting the way you would expect, check to ensure that there are
  no unintentional short circuits.

    <div>
SHORTING THE BATTERY
    </div>
    <div>
  
  There's a specific type of short circuit that's especially bad.    For example, in the battery and LED circuit in
  previous projects, attaching a wire from power to ground with nothing in
  between will cause large amounts of electricity to flow
  through that wire (instead of the LED as intended). This can dissipate your
  power source very quickly, or worst-case (for larger power sources than the
  battery we used), the flow of current can heat up the wire to the point
  where it breaks or causes a fire.</p>

  <h1>Pushing your buttons</h1>
  <p>The pushbutton (or
  just "button") is just a very simple switch – electric current can
  flow through it only when it is pressed.</p>

  <p>Take one of the buttons out of your <strong>I/O (Input/Output)
  RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong> so we can take a closer look at how a button
  works. This is a representation of most basic pushbuttons – they have four
  “legs” that can be attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit and
  then one button in the center of the device that can be pushed (“closed”) or
  released (“open”).  When it is pushed closed, a small metal disk pushes into
  the legs of the button, connecting all four metal legs together.

  <p>Internally, the left side of the button (the two legs on the left) are
  connected together, and the right side of the button (the two legs on the
  right) are connected together:</p>
  <p><mark>Replace drawing below with button used in breadboard diagrams
  <img style="width: 202px;" alt="" src= "img/button2%20cropped.jpg">
  <p>The dashed lines above show the internal wires that permanently connect
  some of the legs together.  So, when using a button, you'll generally want to
  just use two of the legs - either the top two, or the bottom two.

  <p><mark>PIC: Animation of open/closed circuit (lightblub lighting), including
  sideways view of button.

  <p>When we insert a button into a circuit, it has one of two operations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open circuit, no
      electric current can flow through the button and nothing happens.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and closes the
      circuit – electric current can then flow through the button.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
