  <h1>Closed, Open & Short Circuits</h1>

  <p>We have discussed several times throughout this guide that in order for a
  circuit to operate properly -- for electric current to be able to flow -- the
  circuit must be a closed loop.  When we have a circuit that is a closed loop
  and where current is flowing, we call that a <i><b>closed circuit</b></i>. 
  It is always our goal for our circuits to be closed circuits, so that they
  operate as we expect.
  
  <p>When our circuit doesn't form a closed loop, we call that an 
  <i><strong>open circuit</strong></i>.  Actually, by definition, an open
  circuit is not a circuit at all, as electric charge can't flow around a loop 
  that is broken.  Very often when a circuit is not working as expected --
  especially when nothing at all seems to be happening with the circuit --
  the problem is that the circuit doesn't form a complete loop and is an
  open circuit.
  
  <p>Let's take a look at the lightbulb circuit from <a data-uid="electronics"></a>, 
  and cut a wire -- by doing this, we have created an open circuit, current will 
  stop flowing and the light bulb will not illuminate:

		 The Path of Least Resistance
    </div>
    <div>
  <p>An important concept behind electric current is that it will tend to favor
  paths of low resistance over paths of higher resistance.  In other words, if 
  your circuit has two potential paths for current to flow, and if one of those 
  paths has less resistance than the other, more current will flow through the 
  path with less resistance than through the path with more resistance.  

  <p><mark>PIC: Parallel circuit - one path small resistor, one path large
  
  <p>That's not to say <i>all</i> the current will flow through the path of least
  resistance, but that <i>more</i> current will flow through that path.  In fact,
  if a circuit has 10 paths for current to flow, current will flow through all
  10 of those paths, but the paths with the least resistance will have the most
  current flowing through them and the paths with the highest resistance will have
  the least current flowing through them.
  
  <p><mark>PIC: Parallel circuit - Many paths, many resistances

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>

  <p>While we always strive to have a closed circuit, not all closed circuits
  are  going to work as we want or expect.  One particular situation where a 
  closed circuit will often not work correctly is when we have a 
  <i><strong>short circuit</strong></i>.  
  
  <p>A short circuit is a closed circuit where one part of a circuit is 
  <i>unintentionally</i> connected by a plain wire to another part of the circuit, 
  and unintentionally by-passes a set of components.  Electric charge can then flow 
  through a part of the circuit that it was not intended to, and unexpected 
  things can happen.
  
  <p>For example, let's say that we are trying to build a circuit that contains 
  two lightbulbs:

  <p><mark>PIC: Two lightbulb circuit
  
  <p>But, we accidentally add another wire that runs between the two lightbulbs:
  
  <p><mark>PIC: Two lightbulb circuit with a short between the bulbs

  <p>In this case, current has two potential paths that it can follow once it
  gets past the first lightbulb -- one path is through the second lightbulb and 
  one path is directly to the negative terminal of the battery.  We mentioned
  above that current will always flow down every path, but when one path has
  a <i>much lower</i> resistance than another path, nearly all the current will
  tend to flow down the path with the much lower resistance.
  
  <p>A plain wire has almost no resistance.  Therefore, almost all the current
  will flow through the bare wire -- instead of through the second lightbulb --
  and the second lightbulb will not illuminate.  Any time that you see your 
  circuit not acting the way you would expect, check to ensure that there are
  no unintentional short circuits.
  
  <div class="info">
    <div>
Shorting the Battery
    </div>
    <div>
  
  <p>There's one specific type of short circuit that we want to talk about a 
  little more, as it's especially bad.  Not only can it make your circuit 
  not work as expected, but it can even cause damage to various components
  of your circuit.  This situation occurs when you have a short circuit (a 
  plain wire) that connects power to ground with nothing in-between.
  
  <p>For example, this is one example of what shorting the battery might
  look like:
  
  <p><mark>PIC: Battery with single wire from + to -

  <p>Here is another exmaple of shorting the battery:
  
  <p><mark>PIC: Battery with load (lightbulb) and also a short wire in parallel
  
  <p>In that second example, we have a full circuit with a battery and lightbulb,
  and we also have a short that runs directly from the positive terminal of the 
  battery to the negative terminal.  Remember from earlier that if current has
  a choice between two paths, and one path has much <i>much lower</i> resistance,
  most of the current will run through that path.  In this case, most of the 
  current will run from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative
  terminal, directly through the plain wire.
  
  <p>The reason why shorting a battery is so bad is that when you have all the
  current running directly from the positive terminal of the battery to the 
  negative terminal without any load (components) in-between, you will quickly
  drain your battery.
  
  <p>Shorting the battery can actually work with any power source.  For example,
  here is what a short circuit might look like using our breadboard with the
  Raspberry Pi as the power source:

  <p><mark>PIC: Short on the breadboard
  
  <p>In this circuit, we have a short directly from power to ground.  Because
  we have a <i>lot</i> of current running from the Raspberry Pi power source
  directly back to the Raspberry Pi ground, we'll overload the 
  Raspberry Pi electronic circuitry and the Raspberry Pi will likely reboot
  itself.
  
  <p><b>NOTE: If the Raspberry Pi ever reboots for no apparent reason, check
  to see if you have a short circuit on your breadboard.</b>  This will often
  happen if you accidentally wire both power and ground into the same
  breadboard rail, like this:
  
  <p><mark>PIC: 3.3V and GND both plugged into red rail

  <h1>Pushing Your buttons</h1>
  <p>One of the most common -- and versatile -- components in the electronics
  world is the pushbutton (or just "button").  A button is just a very 
  simple switch -- electric current can flow through it only when it is pressed,
  but can't flow through it when it is not pressed.  While buttons are very
  simple in the way they work, when you use them strategically in a circuit --
  and when you combine that circuit with some computer code -- buttons can 
  provide a very versatile way to get information from a user to a computer
  program.
  
  <p>Go ahead and take one of the buttons out of your <strong>Your First Circuit
  RaspberrySTEM Cell</strong>, and let's take a closer look at how it
  works.  This is a very basic pushbutton –- it has four “legs” that can be 
  attached to your breadboard and wired to the circuit, and it has one button in 
  the center of the device that can be pushed (“closed”) or
  released (“open”).  
  
  <p>When the button is left unpressed, the legs are not connected to one another.
  If that button is inserted into a circuit, the circuit is <i>open</i> when 
  the button is unpressed.  As we learned above, in an open circuit, current
  doesn't flow and the components don't do anything.  When the button is pressed, 
  a small metal disk inside of the button case pushes into the legs of the button, 
  connecting all four metal legs together -- this <i>closes</i> the circuit.
  Remember, when a circuit is closed, current will flow and the components in 
  the circuit will operate.

  <p>On thing to note:  Internally, the left side of the button (the two legs 
  on the left) are connected together, and the right side of the button (the two 
  legs on the right) are connected together:</p>
  
  <p><mark>Replace drawing below with button used in breadboard diagrams
  <img style="width: 202px;" alt="" src= "img/button2%20cropped.jpg">
  <p><mark>Animate above drawing to show current flowing on left and right???

  <p>The dashed lines above show the internal wires that permanently connect
  some of the legs together.  So, when using a button, you'll generally want to
  just use two of the legs - either the top two, or the bottom two.

  <p>As we mentioned above, when we insert a button into a circuit, it has one 
  of two operations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is left unpressed, it creates an open circuit, no
      electric current can flow through the button and nothing happens.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>When the button is pressed, the button acts as a wire and closes the
      circuit – electric current can then flow through the button and the 
	  components can operate.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
