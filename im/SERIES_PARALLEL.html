  <h1>Going Loopy</h1>
  <p>All of our first circuits contained just one loop -- that is, just one
  path that ran from the positive side of the power source through some
  components and to the ground of the power source.  In the real-world, 
  circuits are generally more complicated than that, with lots of separate
  paths around the circuit running through lots of components.  In fact, 
  inside microprocessors, there are literally millions of interconnected 
  wires and components, making millions and millions of tiny loops.
  
  <p>As an example, lets start with an example circuit we've seen before, 
  a simple circuit that contains one loop and two components: a battery 
  and a resistor.

    <p><mark>Battery/resistor schematic
	
  <p>When you add a new component to an existing circuit -- assuming it has 
  just two  leads (legs) like a resistor does -- there are two ways you can 
  do it.  The first way is that you can add the component in 
  <i><strong>series</strong></i> with the other component:
  
    <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor series schematic

  <p>Adding a component in series means that you are adding the component
  to the existing loop.  You can add as many components as you want in 
  series -- it simply makes the loop bigger:
  
    <p><mark>Battery/3-resistor series schematic

  <p>The second way to add a component to a circuit is to add the component in 
  <i><strong>parallel</strong></i> with other components:

    <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor parallel schematic

  <p>Adding a component in parallel means that you are creating a new loop
  (path) in the circuit.  You can add as many components as you want in 
  parallel -- it simply adds more paths to the circuit:
  
    <p><mark>Battery/3-resistor parallel schematic 
	
  <p>Of course, you aren't limited to adding components only in series or 
  only in parallel -- you can do both to create more complex circuits that
  do more interesting things:
  
    <p><mark>Battery/multiple-resistor parallel and series schematic

  <p>It's also worth noting that there are some types of components (like 
  a computer chip) that have more than two leads (sometimes dozens or 
  hundreds) -- in these cases, we tend not to talk about series and parallel 
  for that part of the circuit.

  <h1>Series & Parallel Resistance</h1>

  <p>So what happens when you add more resistance in series or parallel?  
  Using the water analogy, we can get a good conceptual idea of what should
  happen.

  <p>When resistances are put in series, the total <i>resistance</i> adds up.
  This becomes important because, if you recall from our <a data-uid="circuits"></a> 
  concept, when voltage stays the same, adding resistance to our circuit 
  allows us to decrease the current (and removing resistance allows us to
  increase the current).

  <p>Here's an example:
  
      <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor series schematic, marked with R1 and R2
    <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER series schematic

  <p>In the electric circuit above, the total resistance of the circuit 
  now becomes R1 + R2.  As you can probably now guess, putting two 
  equal resistances in <i>series</i> gives exactly <i>twice</i> the 
  resistance.  And remembering back to our earlier discuss of
  Ohm's Law, if you keep the voltage the same in the circuit, doubling the 
  resistance will cut the current in half.

  <p>On the other hand, when resistances are put in parallel, the total 
  <i>resistance</i> is divided.  Another way to say this is that the total
  <i>current</i> adds up.   
  
  Again, going back to Ohm's Law, we remember that this is important
  because decreasing
  <p>When resistances are in parallel, the total <i>conductance</i> adds up.
  <i>Conductance</i> is the reciprocal of the resistance.  In other words,
  resistance is a measure of how <i>difficult</i> it is for current to flow
  through a component, while conductance is the opposite - a measure of how
  <i>easy</i> it is for current to flow through a component.  
  This is more evident in a picture:

    <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor parallel schematic, marked with R1 and R2
    <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER parallel schematic

<p>As you increase the number of resistors you allow <i>more</i> current to
flow.  So, in this case, the total
<i>conductance</i> is the sum of the individual <i>conductances</i>, or:
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>R1</sub> + 
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>R2</sub>

<p>The math for this can be a bit more confusing, but is very clear from the
water analogy picture.  Two equal resistors in parallel allow twice the amount
of current to flow, or in other words, they resist the current flow less (half
as much).
<p>So, this means that: 
 <strong>two equal resistances in <i>parallel</i> gives
exactly <i>half</i> the resistance.</strong>
