  <p><strong>This concept is a bit more advanced than most of the other
  concepts in this guide. We've included this concept (and the following
  project) for those who are interested in some more advanced circuit theory
  concepts, but you should feel free to skip this concept and/or the next
  project if you find it overwhelming.</strong></p>

  <h1>Going Loopy</h1>

  <p>All of our first circuits contained just one loop — that is, just one path
  that ran from the positive side of the power source through some components
  and to the ground of the power source. In the real-world, circuits are
  generally more complicated than that, with lots of separate paths around the
  circuit running through lots of components. In fact, inside microprocessors,
  there are literally millions of interconnected wires and components, making
  millions and millions of tiny loops.</p>

  <p>As an example, lets start with an example circuit we've seen before, a
  simple circuit that contains one loop and two components: a battery and a
  resistor.</p><img class="schematic" style="max-width: 200px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Resistors-in-series-1.png">

  <p>When you add a new component to an existing circuit — assuming it has just
  two leads (legs) like a resistor does — there are two ways you can do it. The
  first way is that you can add the component in <i><strong>series</strong></i>
  with the other component:</p><img class="schematic" style="max-width: 200px;"
  alt="" src="img/Resistors-in-series-2.png">

  <p>Adding a component in series means that you are adding the component to
  the existing loop. You can add as many components as you want in series — it
  simply makes the loop bigger:</p><img class="schematic" style=
  "max-width: 200px;" alt="" src="img/Resistors-in-series-3.png">

  <p>The second way to add a component to a circuit is to add the component in
  <i><strong>parallel</strong></i> with other components:</p><img class=
  "schematic" style="max-width: 300px;" alt="" src=
  "img/Resistors-in-parallel-2.png">

  <p>Adding a component in parallel means that you are creating a new loop
  (path) in the circuit. You can add as many components as you want in parallel
  — it simply adds more paths to the circuit:</p><img class="schematic" style=
  "max-width: 400px;" alt="" src="img/Resistors-in-parallel-3.png">

  <p>Of course, you aren't limited to adding components only in series or only
  in parallel — you can do both to create more complex circuits that do more
  interesting things:</p><img class="schematic" style="max-width: 500px;" alt=
  "" src="img/Resistors-in-series-and-parallel.png">

  <p>In the above case, resistors <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i> are in parallel.
  Resistor <i>R3</i> is in series with the combination of <i>R1</i> and
  <i>R2</i> <strong>together</strong>. And <i>R4</i> is in parallel with the
  combination of <i>R1</i>, <i>R2</i> and <i>R3</i>
  <strong>together</strong>.</p>

  <p>It's also worth noting that there are some types of components (like a
  computer chip) that have more than two leads (sometimes dozens or hundreds) —
  in these cases, we tend not to talk about series and parallel for that part
  of the circuit.</p>

  <h1>Series &amp; Parallel Resistance</h1>

  <p>So what happens when you add more resistance in series or parallel? Using
  the water analogy, we can get a good conceptual idea of what should
  happen.</p>

  <p>When resistances are put in series, the total <i>resistance</i> adds up.
  This becomes important because, if you recall from our <a data-uid=
  "circuits"></a> concept, when voltage stays the same, adding resistance to
  our circuit allows us to decrease the current (and removing resistance allows
  us to increase the current).</p>

  <p>Here's an example:</p><img class="schematic" style="max-width: 250px;"
  alt="" src="img/Resistors-in-series-2-labeled.png">

  <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER series schematic</mark></p>

  <p>In the electric circuit above, the total resistance of the circuit now
  becomes R1 + R2. As you can probably now guess, putting two equal resistances
  in <i>series</i> gives exactly <i>twice</i> the resistance. And remembering
  back to our earlier discuss of Ohm's Law, if you keep the voltage the same in
  the circuit, doubling the resistance will cut the current in half.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, when resistances are put in parallel, the total
  <i>resistance</i> is divided. Another way to say this is that the total
  <i>current</i> adds up &mdash; the current going into each of the branches is
  split between the branches proportional to the amount of resistance in the
  branch. Here's a picture: <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 400px;"
  alt="" src="img/Resistors-in-parallel-2-labeled.png"></p>

  <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER parallel schematic</mark></p>

  <p>Without a little bit of math, this may be difficult to conceptualize, but
  the picture above should give you an idea. We don't want to get too mathy
  here, so hopefully our next project will make things a little clearer.</p>
