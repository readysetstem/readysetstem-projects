 <p><strong>This concept is a bit more advanced than most of the other concepts
 in this guide.  We've included this concept (and the following project) for those
 who are interested in some more advanced circuit theory concepts, but you
 should feel free to skip this concept and/or the next project if you find it
 overwhelming.</strong>

  <h1>Going Loopy</h1>

  <p>All of our first circuits contained just one loop &mdash; that is, just one
  path that ran from the positive side of the power source through some
  components and to the ground of the power source. In the real-world, circuits
  are generally more complicated than that, with lots of separate paths around
  the circuit running through lots of components. In fact, inside
  microprocessors, there are literally millions of interconnected wires and
  components, making millions and millions of tiny loops.</p>

  <p>As an example, lets start with an example circuit we've seen before, a
  simple circuit that contains one loop and two components: a battery and a
  resistor.</p>

  <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 200px;" alt="" src= "img/Resistors-in-series-1.png">

  <p>When you add a new component to an existing circuit &mdash; assuming it
  has just two leads (legs) like a resistor does &mdash; there are two ways you can
  do it. The first way is that you can add the component in
  <i><strong>series</strong></i> with the other component:</p>

  <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 200px;" alt="" src= "img/Resistors-in-series-2.png">

  <p>Adding a component in series means that you are adding the component
  to the existing loop. You can add as many components as you want in series &mdash;
  it simply makes the loop bigger:</p>

  <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 200px;" alt="" src= "img/Resistors-in-series-3.png">

  <p>The second way to add a component to a circuit is to add the
  component in <i><strong>parallel</strong></i> with other
  components:</p>

  <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 300px;" alt="" src= "img/Resistors-in-parallel-2.png">

  <p>Adding a component in parallel means that you are creating a new
  loop (path) in the circuit. You can add as many components as you want in
  parallel &mdash; it simply adds more paths to the circuit:</p>

  <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 400px;" alt="" src= "img/Resistors-in-parallel-3.png">

  <p>Of course, you aren't limited to adding components only in series or
  only in parallel &mdash; you can do both to create more complex circuits that do
  more interesting things:</p>

  <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 500px;" alt="" src= "img/Resistors-in-series-and-parallel.png">

    <p>In the above case, resistors <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i> are in parallel.  Resistor
    <i>R3</i> is in series with the combination of <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>
    <strong>together</strong>.  And 
    <i>R4</i> is in parallel with the combination of <i>R1</i>, <i>R2</i> and
    <i>R3</i> 
    <strong>together</strong>.

  <p>It's also worth noting that there are some types of components (like
  a computer chip) that have more than two leads (sometimes dozens or hundreds)
  &mdash; in these cases, we tend not to talk about series and parallel for that
  part of the circuit.</p>

  <h1>Series &amp; Parallel Resistance</h1>

  <p>So what happens when you add more resistance in series or parallel?
  Using the water analogy, we can get a good conceptual idea of what should
  happen.</p>

  <p>When resistances are put in series, the total <i>resistance</i> adds
  up. This becomes important because, if you recall from our <a data-uid=
  "circuits"></a> concept, when voltage stays the same, adding resistance to
  our circuit allows us to decrease the current (and removing resistance allows
  us to increase the current).</p>

  <p>Here's an example:</p>

  <img class="schematic" style="max-width: 250px;" alt="" src= "img/Resistors-in-series-2-labeled.png">

  <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER series
  schematic</mark></p>

  <p>In the electric circuit above, the total resistance of the circuit
  now becomes R1 + R2. As you can probably now guess, putting two equal
  resistances in <i>series</i> gives exactly <i>twice</i> the resistance. And
  remembering back to our earlier discuss of Ohm's Law, if you keep the voltage
  the same in the circuit, doubling the resistance will cut the current in
  half.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, when resistances are put in parallel, the total
  <i>resistance</i> is divided. Another way to say this is that the total
  <i>current</i> adds up -- the current going into each of the branches
  is split between the branches proportional to the amount of resistance in the 
  branch.  Here's a picture:

  <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER parallel
  schematic</mark></p>

  <p>Without a little bit of math, this may be difficult to conceptualize, but 
  the picture above should give you an idea.  We don't want to get too mathy here, so
  hopefully our next project will make things a little clearer.</p>
