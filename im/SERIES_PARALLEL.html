  <h1>Going Loopy</h1>

  <p>All of our first circuits contained just one loop &mdash; that is, just one
  path that ran from the positive side of the power source through some
  components and to the ground of the power source. In the real-world, circuits
  are generally more complicated than that, with lots of separate paths around
  the circuit running through lots of components. In fact, inside
  microprocessors, there are literally millions of interconnected wires and
  components, making millions and millions of tiny loops.</p>

  <p>As an example, lets start with an example circuit we've seen before, a
  simple circuit that contains one loop and two components: a battery and a
  resistor.</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/resistor schematic</mark></p>

  <p>When you add a new component to an existing circuit &mdash; assuming it
  has just two leads (legs) like a resistor does &mdash; there are two ways you can
  do it. The first way is that you can add the component in
  <i><strong>series</strong></i> with the other component:</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor series schematic</mark></p>

  <p>Adding a component in series means that you are adding the component
  to the existing loop. You can add as many components as you want in series --
  it simply makes the loop bigger:</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/3-resistor series schematic</mark></p>

  <p>The second way to add a component to a circuit is to add the
  component in <i><strong>parallel</strong></i> with other
  components:</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor parallel schematic</mark></p>

  <p>Adding a component in parallel means that you are creating a new
  loop (path) in the circuit. You can add as many components as you want in
  parallel &mdash; it simply adds more paths to the circuit:</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/3-resistor parallel schematic</mark></p>

  <p>Of course, you aren't limited to adding components only in series or
  only in parallel &mdash; you can do both to create more complex circuits that do
  more interesting things:</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/multiple-resistor parallel and series
  schematic</mark></p>

  <p>It's also worth noting that there are some types of components (like
  a computer chip) that have more than two leads (sometimes dozens or hundreds)
  &mdash; in these cases, we tend not to talk about series and parallel for that
  part of the circuit.</p>

  <h1>Series &amp; Parallel Resistance</h1>

  <p>So what happens when you add more resistance in series or parallel?
  Using the water analogy, we can get a good conceptual idea of what should
  happen.</p>

  <p>When resistances are put in series, the total <i>resistance</i> adds
  up. This becomes important because, if you recall from our <a data-uid=
  "circuits"></a> concept, when voltage stays the same, adding resistance to
  our circuit allows us to decrease the current (and removing resistance allows
  us to increase the current).</p>

  <p>Here's an example:</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor series schematic, marked with R1 and
  R2</mark></p>

  <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER series
  schematic</mark></p>

  <p>In the electric circuit above, the total resistance of the circuit
  now becomes R1 + R2. As you can probably now guess, putting two equal
  resistances in <i>series</i> gives exactly <i>twice</i> the resistance. And
  remembering back to our earlier discuss of Ohm's Law, if you keep the voltage
  the same in the circuit, doubling the resistance will cut the current in
  half.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, when resistances are put in parallel, the total
  <i>resistance</i> is divided. Another way to say this is that the total
  <i>current</i> adds up. Again, going back to Ohm's Law, we remember that this
  is important because decreasing</p>

  <p>When resistances are in parallel, the total <i>conductance</i> adds
  up. <i>Conductance</i> is the reciprocal of the resistance. In other words,
  resistance is a measure of how <i>difficult</i> it is for current to flow
  through a component, while conductance is the opposite &mdash; a measure of how
  <i>easy</i> it is for current to flow through a component. This is more
  evident in a picture:</p>

  <p><mark>Battery/2-resistor parallel schematic, marked with R1 and
  R2</mark></p>

  <p><mark>PIC: Battery/2-resistor WATER parallel
  schematic</mark></p>

  <p>As you increase the number of resistors you allow <i>more</i>
  current to flow. So, in this case, the total <i>conductance</i> is the sum of
  the individual <i>conductances</i>, or: <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>R1</sub> +
  <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>R2</sub></p>

  <p>The math for this can be a bit more confusing, but is very clear
  from the water analogy picture. Two equal resistors in parallel allow twice
  the amount of current to flow, or in other words, they resist the current
  flow less (half as much).</p>

  <p>So, this means that: <strong>two equal resistances in
  <i>parallel</i> gives exactly <i>half</i> the resistance.</strong></p>
