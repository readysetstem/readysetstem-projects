 <div class="hw" data-count="1" data-name="accelerometer"></div>

 <div id="intro" class="section">

  <p>In this project, we will wire up the accelerometer that we introduced in
  the previous concept and we'll write some code to allow it to measure the
  orientation of the kit.  
 </div>

 <div id="hw" class="section">

   <p>Let's wire up your accelerometer and write some code to get it
  working.</p>

  <h3 class="step">Place the accelerometer on the breadboard</h3>

  <p>The accelerometer has six pins. It should be inserted into the breadboard
  such that each pin sits in a different connect strip, and you should ensure
  that at least one other hole is usable in each connect strip where the
  accelerometer sits. Like this:
  
  <img class="bb" src="img/Accel_unwired_bb.jpg" alt="">
  
  <p>When inserting the accelerometer into the breadboard,
  don't be afraid to apply some pressure from the top &mdash; the bottom of the
  black plastic connectors should touch the breadboard.</p>
  
  <h3 class="step">Wire the accelerometer</h3>

  <div class="info">
   <div>
    WARNING: ACCELEROMETER HOOK-UP
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>It is very important to note that the power and the ground of the
    accelerometer must be connected appropriately.  If you wire VCC (which
	is Power) to ground on the breadboard, or if you wire GND to Power on
	the breadboard, there is a good chance that you will destroy the 
	accelerometer chip (it will likely get warm and start to smoke). 
	So, be extra careful that you hook up the chip as shown below.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>With four wires, wire up the accelerometer like this:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>Wire GND on the accelerometer to GND on the breadboard.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Wire VCC on the accelerometer to 3.3V power on the breadboard.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Wire SCL on the accelerometer to SCL on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Wire SDA on the accelerometer to SDA on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is what your breadboard should look like once the accelerometer is
  properly wired:</p>

  <img class="bb" src="img/Accel_bb.jpg" alt="">

 </div>

 <div id="sw" class="section">

   <p>Let's write some code to test your accelerometer and see how it works:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.accel import Accel
import time

accel = Accel()

while True:
    x_force, y_force, z_force = accel.forces()
    print(x_force, y_force, z_force)
    time.sleep(.1)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize and get
    information from the accelerometer (called <code>Accel()</code>)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 2, we import the <code>time</code> module, as we're going to be
    using a loop and will want to slow the repetition of the loop down a
    bit</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 4, we initialize our accelerometer. We call the
    <code>Accel()</code> function, which returns an "accelerometer object" to
    our <code>accel</code> variable. We talked about that a bit in <a data-uid=
    "vars"></a>, but the important thing to understand is that we can now use
    <code>accel</code> to call other accelerometer functions</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 6, we start a loop (this is where we'll spend all of our time
    once we run the program)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 7, we call the accelerometer function <code>forces()</code>,
    which returns three values, representing the forces in the x-direction,
    y-direction and z-direction</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 8, we print those three values to the screen</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 9, we pause briefly (so we don't overwork the processor) and
    then return to the top of the loop where we read the new values from the
    accelerometer</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Running Your Code</h2>

  <p>If you run your test code, what you should immediately see is that your
  Program Output window starts filling up with numbers. There are three numbers 
  on each line, and those numbers correspond to the values of the X, Y and Z forces.</p>

  <p>If you sit your CREATOR Kit down on a flat surface, you
  should expect the first number to be very close to 0, the second number to be very
  close to 0 and the third number to be very close to 1.  While you might expect the
  numbers to be exactly 0, 0 and 1, in reality, the accelerometer is <strong>very</strong>
  sensitive, and it's unlikely that your surface is 100% flat, so you'll
  probably see readings that are very slightly off from those numbers.</p>

  <p>Play around with the CREATOR Kit and try to get a feel for
  how different movements and rotations affect the numbers on the screen. In
  future projects, we'll be using this functionality to turn the 
  CREATOR Kit into a game controller.</p>

 </div>

 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>Instead of printing the X, Y, and Z forces, can you print (just for the
    X forces) a single "*" for each tenth greater than zero? For example, if
    the force is <span class=nospell>.4xxxx</span>, you would print "****".  If
    the force is <span class=nospell>.7xxxx</span>, you
	would print "*******".  This should give you a good visualization of how
	the values change as the kit is moved.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Can you do the same as above for the Y and Z forces as well?
	</p>
   </li>
