  <p>In this project, we'll expand on the code in the previous <a data-uid=
  "flashlight"></a> project to create a flashing flash light with multiple
  functions. Our new flashlight will have several modes that it rotates through
  on each press of the button. This is common in lots of flashlights you can
  buy today, and it is generally software that makes it possible.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>The hardware for this flashlight will be the same as the last flashlight
  project — two independent circuits, one for the LED and one for the
  button:</p><img class="bb" src="img/Flashlight_bb.jpg" alt="">

  <p>Refer back to <a data-uid="flashlight"></a> if you have any questions
  about how to wire these circuits.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">
  <h2 class="step">Write the code.</h2>

  <p>For this implementation of the flashlight, we're going to create three
  modes — each will do something different. Mode 0 will turn the flashlight
  off, Mode 1 will turn the flashlight on and Mode 2 will flash the light.</p>

  <p>In order to do that, we'll have to track which mode we're in at any given
  time, and we'll have to write the code for each of the modes. We'll start by
  writing some initialization code and implementing Mode 0. The program will be
  similar to the previous project, except we'll add some code highlighted with
  arrows below:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

*NUM_MODES = 3
*mode = 0
*was_pressed = False
while True:
*    is_pressed = my_button.is_pressed()
*    if is_pressed and not was_pressed:
*        mode = mode + 1
*        if mode &gt; NUM_MODES:
*            mode = 0

*    if mode == 0:
        my_led.off()
    else:
        my_led.on()

*    was_pressed = is_pressed
    time.sleep(.01)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's take a look at the code we added:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 8 through 10, we initialize the variables we'll need later to
    track and manage the modes, including <code>NUM_MODES</code>, which defines
    the total number of modes.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 12 and 13, we determine the exact instant the button is
    pressed. This occurs when the button <code>is_pressed</code>, but wasn't
    pressed (<code>not was_pressed</code>) the previous time through the
    loop.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 14 through 16, which occur right when the button is pressed, we
    increment the <code>mode</code>. If we increment past the total number of
    modes (<code>NUM_MODES</code>), we loop it back to the lowest mode. This
    way, the <code>mode</code> will run through the sequence (0, 1, 2, 0, 1,
    2...) each time the button is pressed.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 18 through 21, we check to see if we're in Mode 0, which turns
    the light off. We'll work on the other modes next, but for now, if we're in
    one of the other modes (modes 1 or 2), we'll just turn the light on.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 23, at the end of each run through the loop, we save the state
    of the button as <code>was_pressed</code>, so we know the next time through
    the loop if the button was pressed the previous time through.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Give it a try. Currently, Mode 0 turns the light off, and Modes 1 and 2
  turn the light on. So, as you click through the modes, what you'll see is the
  light turning on, and then two presses later turning off.</p>

  <p>So far, we've added a bunch of code, but we haven't added a lot of
  functionality. But, we have laid the groundwork to add the two new modes in
  the next step.</p>

  <p>Note that the flashlight will continue to work until you manually stop the
  program.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Improve the code.</h2>

  <p>Now, let's add some functionality to Modes 1 and 2. Mode 1 will work as
  before (just turn the light on). Mode 2 will make the light flash. To do
  this, we'll add a counter that keeps track of how many times we've gone
  through the <code>while</code> loop, so we'll know whether the light should
  be on or off each time through the loop.</p>

  <p>Here's what our next version of the code looks like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

*mode2_count = 0
*MODE2_COUNT_TIME = 100

NUM_MODES = 3
mode = 0
was_pressed = False
while True:
    is_pressed = my_button.is_pressed()
    if is_pressed and not was_pressed:
        mode = mode + 1
        if mode &gt; NUM_MODES:
            mode = 0

    if mode == 0:
        my_led.off()
*    elif mode == 1:
*        my_led.on()
*    elif mode == 2:
*        mode2_count = mode2_count + 1
*        if mode2_count &gt; MODE2_COUNT_TIME:
*            mode2_count = 0
*        if mode2_count &lt; MODE2_COUNT_TIME/2:
*            my_led.on()
*        else:
*            my_led.off()

    was_pressed = is_pressed
    time.sleep(.01)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's look at what was added here:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 8 and 9, we initialize the variables we'll need later,
    including <code>MODE2_COUNT_TIME</code>, which will determine how long the
    flashes are in Mode 2.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 23 and 24, we simply turn the light on for Mode 1.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 25 though 28, we implement Mode 2. For mode 2, we use a
    counter, <code>mode2_count</code> to keep track of where we are in the
    flashing cycle. The counter will count from 0 up to
    <code>MODE2_COUNT_TIME</code>, and then repeat.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Lines 29 though 32, we turn the light on or off based on the count.
    Each time through the loop, we check our counter, <code>mode2_count</code>
    — if it is less than half way done, we turn the light on, otherwise we turn
    it off. This will make our light flash 50% on and 50% off.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Give this new "flashing" flashlight a try.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>We used a counter to set the period of time for each flash when in the
    flashing mode. Change the counter to slow down (or speed up) the flashing
    rate.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Can you add a fourth mode that flashes at a faster rate?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The flash mode flashes 50% on and 50% off. Can you change this to a
    quick blink, by making it flash 10% on and 90% off?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>The flashing can be more complicated than just a simple on/off cycle.
    Can you change the flash to 5 quick flashes followed by 2 slow flashes, and
    then repeat?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
