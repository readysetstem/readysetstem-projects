  <p>In this project, we'll expand on the code in the previous <a
data-uid="flashlight"></a> project to create a flashing flash light with multiple
functions.  Our new flashlight will have several mode that it rotates through
on each press of the button.  This is common in lots of flashlights you can buy
today, and it is generally some computer code that makes it possible.

 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">
  <p>The hardware for this flashlight will be the same as the last one &mdash;
  two independent circuits, one for the LED and one for the button:</p>
  </p>

 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">
  <h2 class=step>Write the code.</h2>

<p>This program will be similar to the previous project, except we'll add some
code highlighted with arrows below:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

*NUM_MODES = 3
*mode = 0
*was_pressed = False
while True:
*    is_pressed = my_button.is_pressed()
*    if is_pressed and not was_pressed:
*        mode = mode + 1
*        if mode &gt; NUM_MODES:
*            mode = 0

*    if mode == 0:
        my_led.off()
    else:
        my_led.on()

*    was_pressed = is_pressed
    time.sleep(.01)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The difference here is that we are now keeping track of the state of the
  button to increment a <code>mode</code>:  
  <ul>
  <li><p>
  In Lines 8 through 10: we initialize variables we'll need later, including
  <code>NUM_MODES</code>, the number of on/off modes of our flashlight.
  </p></li> <li><p>
  In Line 23: At the end of each run through the loop, we save the state of the
  button as <code>was_pressed</code>.  
  
  </p></li> <li><p>
  In Lines 12 and 13: given that we know if the button was previously pressed,
  we can now tell the moment a button is pressed &mdash; it occurs when the
  button is <i>currently</i> pressed, but last time through the loop it was
  <i>not</i> pressed.  
  
  </p></li> <li><p>
  In Lines 14 through 16, which occur right when the button is pressed, we
  increment the <code>mode</code>.  When it gets to the max mode, we set it
  back to zero.  This way, the <code>mode</code> will run through the sequence
  (0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2...) each time the button is pressed.

  </p></li> <li> <p>In Lines 18 through 21, we turn the light off for
  <code>mode</code> 0.  All other modes (modes 1 and 2), we turn the light off.
  </p></li> </ul>

  <p>Give it a try. 
  Because modes 1 and 2 both simply turn the light on, you'll have to press the
  button once to turn it on, and twice to turn it back off.  We'll add more
  functionality when we improve the code in the next step.
  The flashlight will continue to work until you manually
  stop the program.</p>
  <h2 class=step>Improve the code.</h2>
  <p>Now, let's add some functionality to modes 1 and 2.  Mode 1 will work as
  before (just turn the light on.  Mode 2 will make the light flash.  To do so,
  we'll add a counter that keeps track of how many times we've gone through the
  <code>while</code> loop:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

my_button = Button(18)
my_led = Output(14)

*mode2_count = 0
*MODE2_COUNT_TIME = 100

NUM_MODES = 3
mode = 0
was_pressed = False
while True:
    is_pressed = my_button.is_pressed()
    if is_pressed and not was_pressed:
        mode = mode + 1
        if mode &gt; NUM_MODES:
            mode = 0

    if mode == 0:
        my_led.off()
*    elif mode == 1:
*        my_led.on()
*    elif mode == 2:
*        mode2_count = mode2_count + 1
*        if mode2_count &gt; MODE2_COUNT_TIME:
*            mode2_count = 0
*        if mode2_count &lt; MODE2_COUNT_TIME/2:
*            my_led.on()
*        else:
*            my_led.off()

    was_pressed = is_pressed
    time.sleep(.01)
</textarea>
  </div>
 <p>Here, we've added code to flash the light in mode 2:
  <ul>
  <li><p>
  In Lines 8 and 9: we initialize variables we'll need later, including
  <code>MODE2_COUNT_TIME</code>, which is the period of time that the light
  will flash when in mode 2.
  </p></li> <li><p>
  In Lines 23 and 24: for mode 1, we simply turn the light on.
  button as <code>was_pressed</code>.  
  
  </p></li> <li><p>
  In Lines 25 though 28: for mode 2, we use a counter, <code>mode2_count</code> to keep track of
  where we are in the flashing cycle.  The counter will count from 0 up to 
  <code>MODE2_COUNT_TIME</code>, and then repeat.
  
  </p></li> <li><p>
  In Lines 29 though 32: for mode 2, we check our counter, <code>mode2_count</code> &mdash; if it
  is less than half way done, we turn the light on, otherwise we turn it off.  This will make our
  light flash 50% on and 50% off.
  </p></li> </ul>

  <p>Give this new flashing light a try.
