  <p>In the previous project, we allowed our Minecraft character to build a
  simple house at the touch of a button. We did no verification that the bottom
  of the house sat on the ground &mdash; in some cases, the house could have been
  built in mid-air.</p>

  <p>In this project, we'll allow our character to construct the same house as
  in the previous project, but in this project, we'll place a base of blocks
  from the bottom of the house well down into the ground.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">
  <p>For this project, we just need a single button, wired to GPIO24:

 <img class="bb" src=
 "img/Minecraft_1button_bb.jpg"></div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>First this project, we'll implement a base (or foundation) for the house if
  it's location is somewhere above ground level.  We'll do this
  using the <code>setBlocks()</code> function, and we'll also take a little shortcut
  &mdash; we'll assume that the house is no more than 64 blocks above the
  ground.

  <p>To implement this, we'll need to draw a large cube below our house, and we'll
  need to pass the location of the two far corners of that cube to the 
  <code>setBlocks()</code> function.

  <h2>Full Code</h2>
  <p>Here is what the code for this project should look like at this point
  (with new changes highlighted with arrows):</p>

  <p>Give it a try.  Remember, the house is only being constructed at a small
  offset from our character, so you may need to move forward and turn around
  to see what you built.

 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li> <p>
   Assuming you still have your controller wired up, add this house making code to 
	the Minecraft controller code (<a data-uid="mccontr3"></a> project) so that you
	can build a house while using the CREATOR Kit as a controller.
   </p> </li> <li> <p>
   We built the foundation out of STONE &mdash; can you change this to BRICK?
   </p> </li> <li> <p> 
   Instead of making the foundation 64 block deep, only
   make it 3 blocks deep.  Then, fly into the air and create a house &mdash;
   you'll be able to fly under it and see your 3 block thick foundation.
   </p> </li> <li> <p>
   Can you create a foundation that is larger than the base of the house in the X and Z directions?
