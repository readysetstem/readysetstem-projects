<div id=intro class=section>
  <p>In this project, we're going to hook up our LED Matrix, and begin writing code to light up
  individual LEDs.
</div>
<div id=hw class=section>
  <p>To get started, make sure you read <a data-uid="ledc"></a> concept, which introduces the LED
  Matrix, how to mount it to the breadboard, power it up, and test it.
  <h3 class=step>Attach the 3.3V Pin to Power and GND to Ground</h3>

  <p>With the cable attached to the LED Matrix, connect the
  3.3V wire and the GND wire, as follows:</p><img class="bb" src=
  "img/LED_Matrix_power_only_bb.jpg" alt="">

  <p>Once power and ground are correctly attached, you should see vertical and
  horizontal bars sweep across the display a single time. This is indication
  that the LED Matrix is powered up and working correctly.</p>
  <h3 class=step>Attach SCLK, MOSI, CE &amp; MISO Pins to Lid Connector
  Board</h3>

  <p>Now that we've verified that the LED Matrix can be powered up and is
  working properly, we can finish wiring it so that we can start controlling it
  with our software. To finish wiring the LED Matrix we need to make the
  following connections:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      <p>Connect SCLK on the LED Matrix to SCLK on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Connect MOSI on the LED Matrix to MOSI on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Connect CE on the LED Matrix to CE0 on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>Connect MISO on the LED Matrix to MISO on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Both CE0 and CE1 are on the Lid Connector Board --
  ensure that you're connected to CE0.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Use a separate jumper wire (this is not included in
  the LED Matrix bag, but you can use any of the provided colored wires) to
  connect MISO from the right side of the LED Matrix to the MISO pin on the Lid
  Connector Board (see the blue wire in the picture below).</p>

  <p>Here is what the breadboard should look like with the LED Matrix fully
  wired:</p><img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_bb.jpg" alt="">


</div>
<div id=sw class=section>
  <p>To display graphics on our LED Matrix, we use a set of functions
  that allows us to create, draw, display and erase a <i>framebuffer</i>.</p>
  <div class="info">
    <div>
      Framebuffers
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>You can think of a framebuffer as a temporary "canvas" that sits
      inside of a computer (specifically inside the computer's memory).</p>

      <p>We use a framebuffer with the LED Matrix. The Ready Set STEM API
      provides a set of functions to use the framebuffer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

          <p><code>FrameBuffer()</code> initializes the framebuffer</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>A number of functions (<code>point()</code>, <code>line()</code>,
          <code>rect()</code>, etc) can be used to draw on the framebuffer.
          Drawing on the framebuffer does NOT appear immediately on the LED
          Matrix.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>The <code>show()</code> function causes the canvas that was stored
          in the computer's memory to instantly become visible LED Matrix.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here is the basic code we'll use to initialize our LED Matrix and draw a
  single dot to it:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
fb = FrameBuffer()
fb.erase()
fb.point(3,3)
fb.show()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize and use a
      framebuffer (the <code>Framebuffer()</code> function)</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 2, we initialize our framebuffer. We call the
      <code>Framebuffer()</code> function, which returns a "framebuffer"
	  to our <code>fb</code> variable. We'll talk about this more in an upcoming
	  concept <a data-uid="fb"></a>, but the important thing to understand is
	  that we can now use the <code>fb</code> variable to call other
	  framebuffer functions</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 3, we call the framebuffer function <code>erase()</code>,
      which erases the framebuffer</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 4, we call the framebuffer function <code>point()</code>,
      which draws a point on the framebuffer, where <code>(3,3)</code> is the coordinates of the point</p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>On Line 5, we call the framebuffer function <code>show()</code>, which
      displays the framebuffer on the LED Matrix</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you run this code, you should see a dot appear on the LED Matrix
  towards the middle of the display.</p>

</div>

<div id=challenge class=section>
  <ol>
    <li>
	  <p>Place a point at another location on the display.  What coordinates do
	  you need to use to put a point at the lower left corner?
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Write a loop to move a dot horizontally across the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Write a loop to move a dot diagonally across the screen.
    </li>
  </ol>
