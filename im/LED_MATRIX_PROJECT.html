 <div id="intro" class="section">

  <p>In this project, we're going to hook up our LED Matrix, and write
  some code to light up individual LEDs.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

 <p>To get started, make sure you read <a data-uid="ledc"></a> concept, which
 introduces the LED Matrix and discusses how to mount it to the breadboard, 
 power it up and test it.</p>
 <h3 class="step">Attach the 3.3V Pin to Power and GND to Ground.</h3>

 <p>With the cable attached to the LED Matrix, connect the 3.3V wire and the
 GND wire, as follows:</p><img class="bb" src=
 "img/LED_Matrix_power_only_bb.jpg" alt="">

 <p>Once power and ground are correctly attached, you should see vertical and
 horizontal bars sweep across the display a single time. This is indication
 that the LED Matrix is powered up and working correctly.</p>
 <h3 class="step">Attach SCLK, MOSI, CE &amp; MISO Pins to Lid Connector
 Board.</h3>

 <p>Now that we've verified that the LED Matrix can be powered up and is
 working properly, we can finish wiring it so that we can start controlling it
 with our software. To finish wiring the LED Matrix we need to make the
 following connections:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>

   <p>Connect SCLK on the LED Matrix to SCLK on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>Connect MOSI on the LED Matrix to MOSI on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>Connect CE on the LED Matrix to CE0 on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

   <p>Connect MISO on the LED Matrix to MISO on the Lid Connector Board.</p>
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p><strong>Note:</strong> Both CE0 and CE1 are on the Lid Connector Board —
 ensure that you're connected to CE0.</p>

 <p><strong>Note:</strong> Use a separate jumper wire (this is not included in
 the LED Matrix bag, but you can use any of the provided colored wires) to
 connect MISO from the right side of the LED Matrix to the MISO pin on the Lid
 Connector Board (see the blue wire in the picture below).</p>

 <p><strong>Note:</strong> When using the LED Matrix, you won't be able to use
 GPIO7 (which is on the same pin as CE1).</p>

 <p>Here is what the breadboard should look like with the LED Matrix fully
 wired:</p><img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_bb.jpg" alt=""></div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>To display graphics on our LED Matrix, we use a set of functions that
  allows us to create, draw, display and erase a <i>framebuffer</i>. We'll talk
  a bunch about framebuffers in an upcoming concept (<a data-uid="fb"></a>),
  but for now, the important thing to understand is that framebuffers are the
  tool we use to manage the LED Matrix display.</p>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Rectangular Coordinates
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>To draw on our LED Matrix, we will rely on something called
    <i>rectangular coordinates</i>, which is a system for defining a location.
    Each of the 64 LEDs on our LED Matrix will be referred to by two numbers —
    the first number will be the distance from the left side of the LED Matrix
    and the second number will be the distance from the bottom of the LED
    Matrix.</p>

    <p>Here is the basis for those two numbers:</p><img style="width: 276px"
    src="img/ledcoordinates.jpg" alt="">

    <p>The first number in our rectangular coordinates refers to the bottom row
    of numbers. The second number in our rectangular coordinates refers to the
    side row of numbers.</p>

    <p>So, if we wanted to refer to the LED in the lower left hand corner of
    the LED Matrix, we would use the coordinates (0,0) — that's the LED that is
    0 from the left and 0 from the bottom. And, if we wanted to refer to the
    LED in the upper right hand corner of the LED Matrix, we would use the
    coordinates (7,7).</p>

    <p>Here is the LED at coordinates (3,6):</p><img style="width: 276px" src=
    "img/ledcoordinates2.jpg" alt="">

    <p>You'll be able to play with these coordinates in the project below.</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here is the basic code we'll use to initialize our LED Matrix and draw a
  single dot to it:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
fb = FrameBuffer()
fb.erase()
fb.point(3,6)
fb.show()
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Let's take a look at what our code is doing:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 1, we import the module we will need to initialize and use a
    framebuffer (the <code>Framebuffer()</code> function)</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 2, we initialize our framebuffer. We call the
    <code>Framebuffer()</code> function, which returns a "framebuffer" object
    to our <code>fb</code> variable. We can now use the <code>fb</code>
    variable to call other framebuffer functions</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 3, we call the framebuffer function <code>erase()</code>, which
    erases the framebuffer</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 4, we call the framebuffer function <code>point()</code>, which
    draws a point on the framebuffer, where <code>(3,6)</code> is the
    coordinates of the point</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>On Line 5, we call the framebuffer function <code>show()</code>, which
    displays the framebuffer on the LED Matrix</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you run this code, you should see a dot appear on the LED Matrix at
  coordinates (3,6) — which is the point we used in our example in the Info Box
  above.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Place a point at another location on the display. What coordinates do
    you need to use to put a point at the lower left corner?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Write a loop to move a dot horizontally across the screen.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Write a loop to move a dot diagonally across the screen.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
