  <p>In this project, we'll build a simple house in the Minecraft world at the
  touch of a button.</p>

 <p>For this project, we just need a single button, wired to GPIO24:

  <p>The code for this project should look very familiar. It is very similar to
  the Minecraft <a data-uid="mcanimation"></a> project, where we drew an animation 
  of our character using blocks. In that project, we were also drawing the sprite 
  on our LED Matrix, so we used 0 to denote LED off and 1-8 and A-F to denote 
  intensity of the LED display.</p>

  <p>Because we're not using the LED Matrix in this project, we don't need to
  include the LED intensity in our sprite design. Instead, we will simply use 0 and 1
  to denote our block types &mdash; 0 will indicate no block (block type AIR) and
  1 will indicate a stone block. We implement this using a list, and the 0 and
  1 are simply indexes in that list.</p>

  <p>The magic happens in a function we've created called <code>create_house()</code>.  
  Similar to the <code>sprite_in_minecraft()</code> function in the 
  <a data-uid="mcanimation"></a> project, we go through a set of nested loops to
  draw blocks in the Minecraft world.  In that project, we drew the animation in
  2 dimensions (X and Y), and therefore we used two nested loops.  In this project,
  we'll draw the house in 3 dimensions, which means we'll need three nested loops.

  <p>The corner of the house is drawn relative to Steve's position, plus an
  <i>offset</i>.  An offset is just a small change in position.  We chose a
  small offset so that the house is close to Steve, but not right on top of
  him.

  <p>Give it a try.  You'll need to fly up and into the house to see the inside.

   <li> <p>
   Assuming you still have your controller wired up, add this house making code to 
	the Minecraft controller code (<a data-uid="mccontr3"></a> project) so that you
	can build a house while using the CREATOR Kit as a controller.
   </p> </li> <li> <p>
   The house is made of AIR and STONE.  Try swapping those materials to get a strange inverted house.
   </p> </li> <li> <p>
   Adjust the <code>offset</code> passed into <code>create_house()</code> so
   that when the house is built, Steve is just outside of it.
   </p> </li> <li> <p>
   Let's be honest &mdash; it's not much of a house.  Make it a little better
   by adding a hole for a door and a flat roof.
