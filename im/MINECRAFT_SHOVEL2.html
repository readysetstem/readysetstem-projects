  <p>In the last project, we learned how to read the list of previous hit
  eventsm, cycle through them and then take some action (printing out the
  coordinates of the block that was hit). In this project, we're going to
  continue with the same idea, but instead of just printing out information
  about the block that was hit, we're going to create an effect on that
  block.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="hw" class="section">

  <p>The hardware configuration for this project is exactly the same as the
  previous project â€” a single button mapped to GPIO24: <img class="bb" src=
  "img/Minecraft_1button_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div id="sw" class="section">

  <p>The code for this project is going to look identical to the code in our
  last project, with one exception, highlighted below:
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.button import Button
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control, block
import time

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

button = Button(24)

while True:
    if button.presses():
        control.hit(duration=0.2)

    hits = mc.events.pollBlockHits()

    for hit in hits:
*        mc.setBlock(hit.pos, block.AIR)

    time.sleep(0.01)
</textarea>
</div>
  <p>In the example above, instead of just printing out where a block was hit, we turn the block into Air, making the block
  disappear.
  <p> The <code>mc.setBlock()</code> function takes two arguments:
  <ol>
   <li><p><strong>The location of the block that was hit:</strong> This was gathered by the
   <code>mc.events.pollBlockHits()</code> function; and</li>
   <li><p><strong>The type of block that should be created in this location:</strong> In this case,
   we're creating a block type of "AIR" &mdash; this is essentially the same as removing the block entirely.</li>
  <p>You've now created a shovel, which, you've probably noticed, does the exact same thing as just smashing blocks.  
  However, our shovel code can be modified to do a whole lot more than just smashing a single block.  In fact, in the 
  next project, we'll expand on our shovel functionality in a way that can't be done without custom programming.
</div>

  <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li><p>Can you modify the code so that instead of breaking the block in front of you, instead you 
   break the block behind you?  How about to the left or right?</p></li> 
  </ol>
 </div>
