 <div class="hw" data-count="4" data-name="button"></div>
 <div class="section" id="intro">

  <p>In our last project, we finished wiring up the four LEDs and tested to
  verify they work. Assuming your buttons and LEDs are all working correctly,
  we've now completed the hardware for our Simon Says game and are ready to
  move on to writing our game code.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was
  completed for the <a data-uid="simon2"></a> project. Here's a reminder:
  <img class="bb" src="img/simon-4but-4led_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>To start programming our game, the first thing we want to do is learn how
  to flash a sequence of LEDs, as this will be the basis for the entire game.
  For this project, we'll start slow and just use a predefined list of LED
  flashes that we make up and write the code to execute that list of flashes.
  In the next project, we'll expand on that by making the flashing sequence
  random.</p>
  <h2 class="step">Add Initialization Code</h2>

  <p>The first thing we're going to need to do is to import the modules and
  functions we'll be using and initialize our list of LEDs. Here's what our
  initialization code should look like (this should look familiar from previous
  projects):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2 class="step">Create a List of LED Flashes</h2>

  <p>For our game, we'll store the sequence of LED flashes in a list. Each item
  in that list will refer to one of the LEDs in our <code>lights[]</code> list
  above. Remember, the first item in a list is considered the zeroth element, so
  if we want to refer to the first LED in <code>lights[]</code>, it would be
  <code>lights[0]</code>. The second LED would be <code>lights[1]</code>, and
  so on.</p>

  <p>So, our list of LED flashes will simply be a list of values between 0 and
  3, each representing an LED in <code>lights[]</code>. Let's call our list
  sequence of LEDs <code>play_order</code> and we'll start by having it run
  through a sequence of LED flashes that we make up (we'll use 8 LED flashes,
  hitting each LED twice).</p>

  <p>Here's what our LED sequence list will look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2 class="step">Play the List of LED Flashes</h2>

  <p>Finally, we want to actually play that sequence of flashes on our LEDs. To
  do that, we'll first ensure that all the LEDs are turned off when we start,
  since we can't be sure of the previous state of the GPIOs. Then, we'll use a
  <code>for</code> loop to run through our sequence list, turning the LEDs on
  one at a time for .4 seconds and then waiting .2 seconds between each
  flash.</p>

    Comments
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>Often when you are writing code, its helpful to put some notes or comments about what the
    code is doing, or why it was written the way it was, or how it works.  All programming
    languages provide a way to do this, but for each language the format is different.  
    <p>In Python,
    if a line ever starts with a hash ('#'), the line is a comment line.  In a comment line you
        can write anything you want, and the computer will just ignore it.  Its purpose is only to
        help out a person who is reading the code.

    <p>For example, the follow is some code preceded by a comment:
    <pre>
# Ensure all lights are off
for light in lights:
    light.off()
</pre>

<p> Its good practice to write comments that explain generally how the code works, or why it is
being written, instead of focusing on the nitty-gritty details. For example, an unnecessary
comment might be:

<pre>
# Assign the variable meaning_of_life the value 42
meaning_of_life = 42
</pre>

   </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here's what the play sequence should look like:</p>
  
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
# Ensure all lights are off
for light in lights:
    light.off()

# Play sequence
for i in play_order:
    lights[i].on()
    time.sleep(0.4)
    lights[i].off()
    time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>
  <h2 class="step">Put It All Together</h2>

  <p>Here is our full code at this point &mdash; when you run it, you will see the
  four LEDs flash in the hard-coded pattern that we've added to the code:</p>
    
    <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]

# Ensure all lights are off
for light in lights:
    light.off()

# Play sequence
for i in play_order:
    lights[i].on()
    time.sleep(0.4)
    lights[i].off()
    time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="challenge">
  <ol>
   <li> <p>
   The <code>play_order</code> only includes numbers 0 through 3, that
   correspond to each of the 4 LEDs.  What happens if you use a number in
   <code>play_order</code> greater than 3?  Why?
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   Can you make the LEDs play in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3...  forever?
   </p></li> <li> <p>
   The example in this section lights up one LED for each item in
   <code>play_order</code>.  Can you modify the code to light more than one LED
   each time through the final for loop?  For example, first light LEDs 0, 1,
   and 2; then 2 and 3, then 0, 2 and 3; and so on...
   </p></li>
