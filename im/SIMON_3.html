  <p>In our last project, we finished wiring up the four LEDs and tested to
  verify they work. Assuming your buttons and LEDs are all working correctly,
  we've now completed the hardware for our Simon-like game and are ready to
  move on to writing our game code.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="hw">
<p>The hardware setup for this project should be the same setup that was 
completed for the <a data-uid="simon2"></a> project.  Here's a reminder:

</div>

  <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>To start programming our game, the first thing we want to do is learn how
  to flash a sequence of LEDs, as this will be the basis for the entire game.
  For this project, we'll start slow and just use a pre-defined list of LED
  flashes that we make up and write the code to execute that list of flashes.
  In the next project, we'll expand on that by making the flashing sequence random.</p>

  <p>The first thing we're going to need to do is to import the modules and
  functions we'll be using and initialize our list of LEDs. Here's what our
  initialization code should look like (this should look familiar from previous
  projects):</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>For our game, we'll store the sequence of LED flashes in a list.  Each
  item in that list will refer to one of the LEDs in our <code>lights[]</code>
  list above.  Remember, the first item in a list is considered the 0th element,
  so if we want to refer to the first LED in <code>lights[]</code>, it would
  be <code>lights[0]</code>.  The second LED would be <code>lights[1]</code>,
  and so on.
  
  <p>So, our list of LED flashes will simply be a list of values between 0 and 3, 
  each representing an LED in <code>lights[]</code>.  Let's call our list sequence
  of LEDs <code>play_order</code> and we'll start by having it run through a 
  sequence of LED flashes that we make up (we'll use 8 LED flashes, hitting each
  LED twice). 

  <p>Here's what our LED sequence list will look like:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Finally, we want to actually play that sequence of flashes on our LEDs.
  To do that, we'll first ensure that all the LEDs are turned off when we start, 
  since we can't be sure of the previous state of the GPIOs. Then, we'll use a 
  <code>for</code> loop to run through our sequence list, turning the LEDs on one 
  at a time for .4 seconds and then waiting .2 seconds between each flash. 
  
  <p>Here's what the play sequence should look like:</p>

  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
    <textarea>
# Ensure all lights are off
for light in lights: 
        light.off()

# Play sequence
for i in play_order: 
        lights[i].on() 
        time.sleep(0.4) 
        lights[i].off()
        time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Here is our full code at this point -- when you run it, you will see the
  four LEDs flash in the hard-coded pattern that we've added to the code:</p>

  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
    <textarea>
# Initialize the LEDs and sequence list

from rstem.gpio import Output
import time

lights = [Output(4), Output(18), Output(24), Output(27)]

play_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]

# Play sequence
for light in lights: 
        light.off()

for i in play_order: 
        lights[i].on() 
        time.sleep(0.4) 
        lights[i].off()
        time.sleep(0.2)
</textarea>
  </div>
  </div>
