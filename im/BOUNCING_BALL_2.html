  <p>In our previous project, we learned how to move a dot on a single axis
  (left to right), and how to keep it from falling off the edge of the screen
  by setting and testing boundaries. 
  
  <p>In this project, we're going to learn to
  move the dot on two axes (left and right, as well as up and down) and learn
  how to constrain the dot on both axes so that it doesn't fall off the
  screen.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="hw">

  <p>Your breadboard should still have the circuit we wired in the <a data-uid=
  "ledp"></a> project. As a reminder, here is what it should look like:
  <img class="bb" src="img/LED_Matrix_bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="sw">

  <p>Adding the boundary functionality along the other axis (the Y axis) is
  actually pretty simple. In addition to changing the X location by 1 each time
  through the loop, we also do the same with the Y location. This requires
  another <code>direction</code> variable to keep track of the Y axis
  direction. To avoid confusion with the variable names, we'll also change the
  previous variable <code>direction</code> to <code>x_direction</code></p>

  <p>In addition, we need to increment in the Y direction each time through the
  loop and test whether we've hit the Y axis edge.</p>

  <p>Here is the final code, with the new code marked with arrows:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
from rstem.led_matrix import FrameBuffer
import time

# Initialize the game environment
fb = FrameBuffer()
x, y = (0, 0)
x_direction = 1
*y_direction = 1

while True:
    # Get user input

    # Update the game world
    x += x_direction
    y += y_direction
    if (x &lt;= 0) or (x &gt;= 7):
        x_direction = -x_direction
*    if (y &lt;= 0) or (y &gt;= 7):
*        y_direction = -y_direction

    # Draw graphics on the screen
    fb.erase()
    fb.point(x, y)
    fb.show()

    # Wait for some period of time
    time.sleep(.5)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Give it a try. You should now see the dot moving on the
  display in two directions simultaneously.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="challenge" class="section">
  <ol>
   <li>

    <p>Set the initial position of the ball to something other than (0, 0) to
    make the bouncing a little more interesting. Can you get it to bounce in a
    diamond shape?</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>As is, the ball moves the same distance in both the X and Y directions
    each time it is moved. Can you increase the distance the ball moves in one
    of the directions each time it's moved.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>Using one of the <code>random</code> functions, can you add a little
    randomness to the ball's position (perhaps move it a random distance each
    time it's moved) to make the ball wiggle about the display?</p>
