  <h1>IF Statements</h1>

  <p>Much of our lives are spent asking questions in order to figure out what
  we should be doing next. For example, we may ask a friend, "Is it time for
  lunch?" If his answer is "Yes," the next things we'll likely be doing is
  eating lunch. If his answer is "No," we'll be doing something else next &mdash; in
  fact, oftentimes, we'll just continue doing whatever it was we were doing
  before we asked the question!</p>

  <p>As another example, you might ask a friend, "Do you want to see a movie
  today?" If he says, "Sure," you'll probably next spend some time figuring out
  what movie to see. But, if he says, "Nah, I'd rather go play in the park,"
  the rest of your day will probably go much differently.</p>

  <p>Programming is very similar &mdash; we often ask a lot of questions in our
  software to determine what we should do next. For example, when you push a
  button on your television remote control, it sends a signal to your TV
  telling the TV to change the station or adjust the volume. But, what you
  probably don't realize is that this works because many times per second, the
  software in your TV is asking, "Did someone just press a button on the remove
  control?"</p>

  <p>Most of the time the answer is "No," so the TV software moves onto
  something else for a short period of time (likely whatever else it was already
  doing). But, if the answer is "Yes" (in other words, if you were pressing a
  button on the remote), the TV will then take action to determine what button
  was pressed and then carry out the request.</p>

  <p>The most basic way for software to ask and respond to a question is by
  using what is known as an <code>if</code> statement. An <code>if</code>
  statement asks a <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> question and, based
  on the answer, takes the appropriate action.</p>

  <p>As another example, let's say we have a circuit that contains a
  thermometer and sends the current temperature back to computer every once in
  a while. Next, let's assume that we use a variable named
  <code>temperature</code> to store the data the thermometer sends us. Finally,
  let's pretend that the most recent temperature sent to us by the thermometer
  is 95 degrees. This is represented by our variable like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
temperature = 95
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The software might then use an <code>if</code> statement to evaluate the
  temperature and comment on it if it's over 90 degrees:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
if temperature &gt; 90:
    print ("Wow, it's hot out there!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>&gt;</code> sign is called an
  <i>operator</i>, and it means "Greater Than" &mdash; we'll talk about how this, and
  many other operators, work later in this tutorial.</p>

  <p>Now, type these three lines into your code window, run the program and see
  what happens:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
temperature = 95

if temperature &gt; 90:
    print ("Wow, it's hot out there!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>If you run the program, you'll see that the computer prints, "Wow, it's
  hot out there!" in your output window. In this case, the computer evaluated
  the statement (<code>temperature &gt; 90</code>), determined that the
  statement was <code>True</code> (the temperature is 95, which is over 90) and
  then took the specified action based on the fact that the statement was
  <code>True</code>.</p>

  <p>But, what if the code determined that the statement were
  <code>False</code>? For example, give this piece of code a try:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
temperature = 95

if temperature &lt; 90:
    print("Okay, it's not too hot out there.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In this case, the temperature is still defined as 95 degrees, but this
  time, we're asking if the temperature is <i>less than</i> 90. The answer to
  that question is <code>False</code> (the temperature is not less than 90).
  And because the statement is <code>False</code>, the action following the
  <code>if</code> statement is not executed, and nothing is printed to the
  screen.</p>

  <p>We typically call the evaluation line a "conditional statement," call the
  comparison the "condition" and call the action commands after the conditional
  statement the "code block."</p>

  <p>So, in this case, the following is the conditional statement:</p>
  <pre>
  if temperature &lt; 90:
</pre>

  <p>The following is the condition:</p>
  <pre>
  temperature &lt; 90
</pre>

  <p>And this is the code block:</p>
  <pre>
  print("Okay, it's not too hot out there.")
</pre>

  <p>We'll be using those terms from here on out.</p>

  <p>Now, let's discuss some additional features of conditional statements and
  code blocks…</p>
  <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>

  <p>In the above examples, we used the symbols &gt; and &lt; in our
  conditional statements. We used &gt; to ask the question, "Is the first value
  greater than the second value?" And, we used the symbol &lt; to ask the
  question "Is the first value less than the second value?"</p>

  <p>These are just two of several symbols (we call them "operators") that can
  be used to compare values in a conditional statement. Here is the list of the
  most common comparison operators:</p>
  <div align="center">
   <table class="basic">
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td>

       <p>OPERATOR</p>
      </td>
      <td>

       <p>DEFINITION</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       <p style="text-align: center"><strong>==</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td>

       <p>Is Equal To?</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       <p style="text-align: center"><strong>!=</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td>

       <p>Is Not Equal To?</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       <p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td>

       <p>Is Greater Than?</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       <p style="text-align: center"><strong>&lt;</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td>

       <p>Is Less Than?</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       <p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;=</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td>

       <p>Is Greater Than or Equal To?</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       <p style="text-align: center"><strong>&lt;=</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td>

       <p>Is Less Than or Equal To?</p>
      </td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
  </div>

  <p>Let's look at some examples…but first, let's define a couple variables to
  use in our examples:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
my_dogs_age = 4
my_age = 43
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>Now for our examples:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_dogs_age == 4</code> would evaluate
  as <code>True</code></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age != 43</code> would evaluate as
  <code>False</code></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age &gt; my_dogs_age</code> would
  evaluate as <code>True</code></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age &lt; my_dogs_age</code> would
  evaluate as <code>False</code></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_dogs_age &gt;= 4</code> would
  evaluate as <code>True</code></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><code>my_age &lt;= 35</code> would evaluate as
  <code>False</code></p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that = and == are very different in
  programming. The = sign tells the computer that we're assigning the value of
  one thing (whatever is on the right side of the = sign) to another thing (the
  variable on the left side of the = sign). But, the == asks the computer
  whether two things are equal, and returns a <code>True</code> (if they are
  equal) or a <code>False</code> (if they are not equal).</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Complex Conditions</h1>
  <h2>Code Blocks</h2>

  <p>In all the examples so far in this chapter, our code blocks have consisted
  of a single line of code. For example, in this piece of code:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
temperature = 95

if temperature &lt; 90:
    print("Okay, it's not too hot out there.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>our code block was a single print statement.</p>

  <p>But in many situations, after evaluating a conditional, we're going to
  want to take action that requires many commands, not just one. For this
  reason, code blocks can be any number of commands following a conditional
  statement. Our example above could be changed to:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
temperature = 85

if temperature &lt; 90:
    print("Okay, it's not too hot out there.")
    print("It's only", temperature, "degrees.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In this example, we have two print statements in our code block. Notice
  that both commands are indented the exact same amount &mdash; this is how the
  computer knows that all the lines are part of the same code block.
  <strong>It's very important that you use the same number of spaces or tabs
  for every line of the code block</strong>, or your code will not function as
  you expect (and may not function at all).  And, space and tab characters are
  different, even though it is hard to tell as they are both invisible.  You must stick with
  all spaces or all tabs, not both.  <strong>All
  the code examples in this guide use tabs, not spaces, so we suggest you do
  the same.</strong></p>
  <h2>Compound Conditional Statements</h2>

  <p>In some situations, you may find that you need to have more complex
  conditional statements in your code than just a single comparison. When that
  need arises, we can use <i>compound</i> conditional statements, which is
  really just a fancy way of saying that we can put multiple comparisons
  together into a single conditional statement.</p>

  <p>For example, in the previous section, we used the condition:</p>
  <pre>
  temperature &lt; 90
</pre>

  <p>to determine if it was less than 90 degrees outside.</p>

  <p>But, what if we didn't just want to know if the temperature was less than
  90 degrees &mdash; we wanted to know whether the temperature was between 80 and 90
  degrees? That would actually require two different conditions:</p>
  <pre>
  temperature &gt; 80
  temperature &lt; 90
</pre>

  <p>We can create a compound conditional statement that will check both of
  those comparisons before taking any action, as follows:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
if (temperature &gt; 80) and (temperature &lt; 90):
    print("The temperature is between 80 and 90 degrees.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>and</code> keyword tells the computer that both statements must
  be <code>True</code> in order for the entire compound conditional statement
  to be <code>True</code>.</p>

  <p>What if we only cared about the situation where the temperature was less
  than 80 degrees or more than 90 degrees? We can create a compound conditional
  statement to do this as well:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
if (temperature &lt; 80) or (temperature &gt; 90):
    print("The temperature is not between 80 and 90 degrees.")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>In this case, the <code>or</code> keyword tells the computer that either
  one or both of the statements must be <code>True</code> in order for the
  entire compound conditional statement to be <code>True</code>.</p>

  <p>Any number or combination of <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> keywords
  can be used to combine conditional statements.</p>

  <p>Finally, the <code>not</code> keyword works just like <i>not</i> in
  English &mdash; it tests if the opposite of a condition is <code>True</code>. For
  example, the following if statements are written differently, but test the
  same exact thing:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
if temperature != 80:
    print("It is not exactly 80 degrees.")
if not temperature == 80:
    print("It is still not exactly 80 degrees.")
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>Adding ELSE</h1>
  <h2>IF/ELSE Statements</h2>

  <p>In our previous examples, we evaluated a conditional, and took action if
  the result of the evaluation was <code>True</code>. But, in many cases, we
  also want to take action when the result of the evaluation is
  <code>False</code>, in addition to when it's <code>True</code>.</p>

  <p>For example, perhaps we don't just want to let the user know if the
  temperature is over 90 degrees, but we also want to let the user know if the
  temperature is under 90 degrees:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
if temperature &gt; 90:
    print("Over 90 degrees &mdash; make sure to wear sunscreen.")
else:
    print("Under 90 degrees today &mdash; keep warm!")
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>We use the <code>else</code> keyword to indicate what action should be taken if the
  conditional statement evaluates to <code>False</code>. We are basically
  telling the computer:</p>

  <p><i>If the conditional statement is true, do this. Otherwise
  (<code>else</code>), do that.</i></p>
  <h2><span class="nospell">ELIF</span> Statements</h2>

  <p>There are going to be some cases where, "If true, do this. If false, do
  that," just isn't enough to provide the functionality you need.</p>

  <p>For example, perhaps we want to know more than whether the temperature is
  above or below 90 degrees? Perhaps we want to know, is it below 60 degrees?
  Or in the 60s? Or in the 70s? Or in the 80s? Or in the 90s? Or above 90
  degrees?</p>

  <p>In the case where you want to test for many different conditions, you can
  use the <code>elif</code> ("else if") statement. Like this:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="0">
   <textarea>
if temperature &lt; 60:
    print("Brrrr…under 60 degrees.")
elif temperature &lt; 70:
    print("Between 60 and 70 degrees.")
elif temperature &lt; 80:
    print("Between 70 and 80 degrees.")
elif temperature &lt; 90:
    print("Between 80 and 90 degrees.")
else:
    print("It is over 90 degrees.")
</textarea>
  </div>
 </div>
</body>
</html>
