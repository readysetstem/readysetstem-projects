  <h1>What is Electricity?</h1>

  <p><mark>PIC: Need generic electricity image or diagram, or cartoon</mark>

  <p>Electricity is one of the most basic needs of our modern 21st century lives.
  Electricty is used to heat and light our homes; to power our electronic toys,
  games and gadgets; and to run our appliances, tools, and equipment.  But,
  perhaps most importantly, electricity enables us to use microprocessors --
  which are the brains of all modern computers, including phones, laptops, tablets 
  and more.  But, what is electricity?

  <p>Electricity is a flow of <i>charged particles</i>.  
  When charged particles are allowed to flow from one place to another, they
  transfer energy that can be used to power everything from a light bulb to an
  entire city. All of our everyday electronic gadgets – from cell phones to
  computers to microwave ovens – are powered by the flow of charged particles.
  
  <p>Electricity occurs naturally in everyday phenomemon such a lightning bolts
  and static shocks.  Only in the past few centuries has man has discovered
  how to harness energy in various forms and convert it to electricity, which
  can then be sent over large distances and allow us to heat and light
  our homes, as well as to run machines and gadgets in our offices and factories.

  <p>And, just in the past 50 years, we've taken another major step -- creating the
  mirocprocessor, which harnesses the power of electricity to control the flow
  of information.  With the microprocessor, we can perform calculations at
  speeds that are not humanly possible.  By mixing microprocessors with electronic
  circuits, we can create devices that make our lives easier, more efficient
  and more fun.

  <h2>What is a Circuit?</h2>

  <p>A circuit is a closed loop that allows charged particles (or just
  <i>charge</i>) to flow through it. The parts of a circuit that charge flows
  through are called <i>conductors</i> -- the most common form of conductor is
  a metal wire.  Conductors are the most basic building blocks of circuits, and
  when you string together conductors in a closed loop, you have created an
  electric circuit.
  
  <p>In addition to conductors/wires, a typical circuit also has a power source and 
  other components. The power source is what forces the charge to flow through the
  circuit.  A common power source is a battery.  the components are the parts of 
  the circuit that are affected by the electric charge as it passes through them.
  Common components are things like lights, motors, switches, buttons, etc.</p>

<mark>PIC: Battery lightbulb circuit - animated</mark>

  <p>For example, the circuit above contains a battery (a power source) and a lightbulb
  (a component), attached together with wires (conductors).  The battery forces
  charge through the wires.  When the charge flows through the lightbulb, 
  it lights up.</p>

  <p>Some circuits are very simple (like our battery and lightbulb example),
  while other circuits are very complicated, containing many power sources,
  thousands of wires and dozens (or hundreds) of components.</p>
</div>

<div class=section>
  <h1>The Water Analogy</h1>
  
  <p>It can be hard to get an intuitive understanding of electricity because it's
  invisible.  Charge flows through wires, but you
  can't see it.  Sometimes it's easier to understand something complicated by
  using an <i>analogy</i> -- another situation that works in a similar way.
  
  <p>A good analogy for electricity is water.  The flow of <i><b>charge through 
  a conductor</b></i> is very similar to the flow of <i><b>water through a 
  pipe</b></i>.  While this analogy isn't perfect, there are many similarities 
  between flowing charge and flowing water.  In fact, the two are so similar
  that we use many of the same equations to describe electric circuits as we use
  to describe water flowing through pipes.  
  
  <p>Most of the electrical concepts throughout this Projects Guide use the water 
  analogy to give a simple and intuitive understanding of what is going on inside 
  of a circuit.  These analogies allow you to understand what's happening inside 
  a circuit without needing to know any equations (though we'll briefly discuss
  one of the most important equations later in this guide).
  
  <p>Here is a visual representation of the water analogy -- a simple circuit 
  with a battery is <i>analogous</i> to water flowing through a closed loop of pipe:
  
<p><mark>PIC: Battery only circuit - animated, compared to water analogy,
animated</mark>

  <p>Note:  Because there is only a power source and no other components in
  this circuit, if you actually built it, you wouldn't see it do anything.  In
  fact, a circuit like this with no components is called a <i><b>short
  circuit</b></i>, and because all it's doing is pushing
  charge around the closed loop, it would quickly drain the battery.  This
  is one of the reasons why we try to avoid short circuits.
        
  <p>In the visual example above, the battery forces charge around a closed 
  circuit.  And, the pump forces water molecules around a closed system of pipes.  Here
  is a breakdown of the analogous components of the two systems:

        <td><p>Charge</td>
        <td><p>Water</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <p>Before we go any further, let's talk a little bit more about the power sources
  and conductors used in our analogy above, just to give a better idea of where the
  analogy is good, and also where the analogy starts to break down.
  
  <h2>Power Source</h2>
  
  <p><mark>PIC: generic drawing or stock photo of a battery</mark>
  
  <p>As mentioned earlier, power sources provide the energy to make charge flow in 
  circuits.  There are many different types of power sources, and we'll talk more 
  about them later in the Projects Guide.

  <p>In our simple electrical circuit in the previous section, the power source
  is a battery.  A battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy.  In
  other words, inside 
  a battery, a specific chemical reaction occurs that causes charge to 
  be pulled into one side of the battery, and pushed out the other.
  
  <p>In the water analogy, the power source is a pump - a device that pulls water 
  into one side, and pushes water out the other side, analogous to our battery.

  <p>What's great about this analogy is it is intuitively obvious that exactly as 
  much stuff (charge/water) goes into the power source (battery/pump) as comes out.  
  The battery does not <i>create</i> the charge that is being pushed 
  around the circuit, just as a pump does not <i>create</i> water that is being
  pushed through the pipes.
  
  <p>Remember though, the water pump is just a <i>model</i> of the battery.  Unlike
  the pump, the battery does not have any spinning moving parts inside.  Both 
  batteries and water pumps are similar in that they convert one form of energy 
  (chemical energy for the battery and mechanical energy for the pump) into another 
  form of energy (electrical energy).
  
  <h2>Conductors</h2>
  
  <p><mark>PIC: generic drawing or stock photo of wires</mark>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, conductors are the "pipes" of a circuit.  Conductors 
  are made of materials that allow charge to flow freely through them.  In general, 
  this means conductors are made out of metal, with copper being one of the most common 
  metals used.
  
  <p>One of the ways that the water analogy holds true is that just like water pipes
  are always filled with water (whether or not the water is flowing), conductors are
  always filled with charge.  That said, there are also some important differences 
  between conductors and pipes that you should keep in mind:

  <ul>
    <li><p>Real water pipes can leak water.  But, conductors cannot leak charge &mdash; 
	the charged particles are held too tightly to the conductor to escape.
    </li>
    <li><p>With a water pipe, the water flows <i>inside</i> the pipe.  But, with
	metal conductors, the charge flows <i>throughout</i> the metal, not just inside 
	of it.  Unlike with a water pipe, with a conductor there is no outside part that 
	keeps the charge in -- they are simply held in by some inherent 
	properties of the metal.  That said, many wires will also have a
	plastic coating over them -- this coating is an <i>insulator</i>, which means that
	it doesn't allow charge to flow through it.  You'll see that the wires in our
	kit come in many different colors -- these are the colors of the insulators that
	are wrapped around the metal wires.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Important Terminology</h1>
  
  <h2>Voltage, Current & Resistance</h2>
  <p>Voltage, current & resistance are the three most common measurements that can be
  made in an electrical circuit.  We'll discuss each of these more in an upcoming 
  concept, but for the next couple projects, it will be useful to have a rough idea of 
  what these things are:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Voltage:</strong> The difference in charge between two points
    in a circuit.  The higher the voltage in an electrical circuit, the more "forcefully" 
	the charge will flow from one end of the circuit to the other.  In our water
	analogy, higher voltage would be analogous to a larger water pump that could push 
	water through the pipes with increased pressure. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Current:</strong> The rate of flow of electric charge.  The higher
	  the current in an electrical circuit, the more charge that is flowing 
	  through the circuit in a specific period of time.  In our water analogy, higher
	  current would be analogous to the water moving faster through the pipe.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Resistance:</strong> The amount that a circuit component
      reduces the flow of charge.  The higher the resistance in an electrical circuit,
	  the lower the rate of charge flowing through the circuit.  In our 
	  water analogy, higher resistance would be analogous to making a section of the
	  <mark>pipe thinner</mark>, which would restrict the amount of water flow through the system.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Power, Load & Ground</h2>

  <p><mark>PIC: Lightbulb circuit with Power Ground and load marked.

  <p>Power, load & ground are three common parts of any electrical circuit.  We'll 
  discuss each of these more in an upcoming concept, but for the next couple projects, 
  it will be useful to have a rough idea of what these things are:

  <ul>
    <li>

      <p><strong>Power:</strong> This is generally the point of highest 
      charge in an electrical circuit -- for example, the positive terminal 
	  of your battery is typically what we consider the location of power in a
	  circuit.  This point in a circuit is sometimes generically called "Vcc" -- 
	  or in the case of most of the projects we'll be doing, it will be referred to
	  as "3.3V" (since the power source we'll be using will be 3.3 volts).  The power 
	  source provides the energy that makes the circuit do something useful.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Load:</strong> This is the part of an electrical circuit that 
	  actually uses the flow of charge to do something useful.  In our circuits,
	  these will be the components -- things like lights, buttons, speaker, etc.
	  Above, we talked about circuit <i>resistance</i> -- a load is a part of the 
	  circuit that provides resistance. The load uses the energy that the power source
      provides to do something useful.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Ground:</strong> In an electric circuit, ground is generally
      the point of lowest charge in the circuit. For example, in our lightbulb 
	  circuit above (and in most of the circuits we will build), the negative terminal 
	  of the battery is the point of lowest charge, and would be the <i>ground</i> 
	  point of the circuit.  The reason we use the term "ground" is because in many
      electrical applications (like the electricity running through your
      house), the earth (the actual ground) is used as both our reference point of 
	  lowest charge and our physical point of attaching the electrical circuit -- if
	  you looked at the place where electricity comes into your house, you might see 
	  that there is a metal rod that connects this location to deep underground.</p> 
    </li>

  </ul>

  <div class="info">
    <div>
      Grounding Yourself
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>In our assembly guide, we mentioned that you should "ground" yourself
      before touching electronic components. Now that you have a conceptual
      idea of what ground is, we can explain this further. Have you ever gotten
      a static shock by touching someone or something? Sometimes, electric
      charge builds up in your body. This charge is then released -- in the
      form of a static discharge (or shock) when you touch someone or something
      that has a different amount of charge. In other words, if there is a
      voltage difference between you and some object, and you touch that
      object, you'll get a shock. Once your body has discharged the excess
      charge, you don't get any more shocks -- until, of course, you build up
      more charge.</p>

      <p>If you were to touch an electrical component when you have a charge
      built up in your body, that resulting static shock that you feel could
      very well be enough to zap the component and break it (we sometimes call
      this "frying the component.") So, to avoid frying any electrical
      components, we recommend that you discharge any excess charge in your
      body before touching the components.</p>

      <p>You can ground yourself by touching any piece of metal that is
      connected via some relatively direct path to the earth. Since all the
      electrical outlets in your house are connected to earth ground, you can
      generally ground yourself by touching the metal case of an electrical
      device that is plugged in. On the CREATOR Kit, you can
      touch the metal casing on any of the USB ports or the Ethernet port on
      the back of the Raspberry Pi -- assuming the CREATOR Kit is
      plugged into a wall outlet.</p>
