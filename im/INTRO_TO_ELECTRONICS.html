  <h1>What is Electricity?</h1><img src="img/lightning-strikes-perth-3.jpg"
  style="max-width: 600px;" alt="">

  <p>Electricity is one of the most basic needs of our modern 21st century
  lives. Electricity is used to heat and light our homes; to power our
  electronic toys, games and gadgets; and to run our appliances, tools, and
  equipment. Perhaps most importantly, electricity enables us to use
  microprocessors — which are the brains of all modern computers, including
  phones, laptops, tablets and more. But, what is electricity?</p>

  <p>Electricity is a flow of <i>charged particles</i>. When charged particles
  are allowed to flow from one place to another, they transfer energy that can
  be used to power everything from a light bulb to an entire city. All of our
  everyday electronic gadgets — from cell phones to computers to microwave
  ovens — are powered by the flow of charged particles.</p>

  <p>Electricity occurs naturally in everyday phenomenon such a lightning bolts
  and static shocks. Only in the past few centuries has mankind discovered how
  to harness energy in various forms and convert it to electricity, which can
  then be sent over large distances to heat and light our homes,
  as well as to run machines and gadgets in our offices and factories.</p>

  <p>And, just in the past 50 years, we've taken another major step — creating
  the microprocessor, which harnesses the power of electricity to control the
  flow of information. With the microprocessor, we can perform calculations at
  speeds that are not humanly possible. By mixing microprocessors with
  electronic circuits, we can create devices that make our lives easier, more
  efficient and more fun.</p>
  <h2>What is a Circuit?</h2>

  <p>A circuit is a closed loop that allows charged particles (or just
  <i>charge</i>) to flow through it. The parts of a circuit that charge flows
  through are called <i>conductors</i> — the most common form of conductor is a
  metal wire. Conductors are the most basic building blocks of circuits, and
  when you string together conductors in a closed loop, you have created an
  electric circuit.</p>

  <p>In addition to conductors/wires, a typical circuit also has a power source
  and other components. The power source is what forces the charge to flow
  through the circuit. A common power source is a battery. The components are
  the parts of the circuit that are affected by the electric charge as it
  passes through them. Common components are things like lights, motors,
  switches, buttons, etc.</p>

    Battery</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>For example, the circuit above contains a battery (a power source) and a
  lightbulb (a component), attached together with wires (conductors). The
  battery forces charge through the wires. When the charge flows through the
  lightbulb, it lights up.</p>

  <p>Some circuits are very simple (like our battery and lightbulb example),
  while other circuits are very complicated, containing multiple power sources,
  thousands of wires and dozens (or hundreds) of components.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h1>The Water Analogy</h1>

  <p>It can be hard to get an intuitive understanding of electricity because
  it's invisible. Charge flows through wires, but you can't see it. Sometimes
  it's easier to understand something complicated by using an <i>analogy</i> —
  another situation that works in a similar way.</p>

  <p>A good analogy for electricity is water. The flow of <i><b>charge through
  a conductor</b></i> is very similar to the flow of <i><b>water through a
  pipe</b></i>. While this analogy isn't perfect, there are many similarities
  between flowing charge and flowing water. In fact, the two have so many
  similarities that we use many of the same equations to describe electric
  circuits as we use to describe water flowing through pipes.</p>

  <p>Most of the electrical concepts throughout this guide use the water
  analogy to give a simple and intuitive understanding of what is going on
  inside of a circuit. These analogies allow you to understand what's happening
  inside a circuit without needing to know any equations (though we'll briefly
  discuss one of the most important equations later in this guide).</p>

  <p>Here is a visual representation of the water analogy — a simple circuit
  with a battery is <i>analogous</i> to water flowing through a closed loop of
  pipe:</p>

  <p>Note: Because there is only a power source and no other components in this
  circuit, if you actually built it, you wouldn't see it do anything. In fact,
  a circuit like this with no components is called a <i><b>short
  circuit</b></i>, and because all it's doing is pushing charge around a closed
  loop with no components, it would quickly drain the battery. This is one of
  the reasons why we try to avoid short circuits.</p>

  <p>In the visual example above, the battery forces charge around a closed
  circuit. And, the pump forces water molecules around a closed system of
  pipes. Here is a breakdown of the analogous components of the two
  systems:</p>

     </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Before we go any further, let's talk a little bit more about the power
  sources and conductors used in our analogy above, just to give a better idea
  of where the analogy is good, and also where the analogy starts to break
  down.</p>
  <h2>Power Source</h2>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, power sources provide the energy to make charge flow
  in circuits. There are many different types of power sources, and we'll talk
  more about them in more depth in a later tutorial.</p><img src=
  "img/batteries-640x480.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;" alt="">

  <p>In our simple electrical circuit in the previous section, the power source
  is a battery. A battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. In
  other words, inside a battery, a specific chemical reaction occurs that
  causes charge to be pulled into one side of the battery, and pushed out the
  other.</p>

  <p>In the water analogy, the power source is a pump — a device that pulls
  water into one side, and pushes water out the other side, analogous to our
  battery.</p>

  <p>What's great about this analogy is it is intuitively obvious that exactly
  as much stuff (charge/water) goes into the power source (battery/pump) as
  comes out. The battery does not <i>create</i> the charge that is being pushed
  around the circuit, just as a pump does not <i>create</i> water that is being
  pushed through the pipes.</p>

  <p>Remember though, the water pump is just a <i>model</i> of the battery.
  Unlike the pump, the battery does not have any spinning moving parts inside.
  But, both batteries and water pumps are similar in that they are the sources of 
  energy for their respective circuits.</p>

  <h2>Conductors</h2>

  <p>Conductors are the "pipes" of a circuit. Conductors are made of materials
  that allow charge to flow freely through them. In general, this means
  conductors are made out of metal, with copper being one of the most common
  metals used.</p><img src="img/wires.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;" alt="">

  <p>One of the ways that the water analogy holds true is that just like water
  pipes are always filled with water (whether or not the water is flowing),
  conductors are always filled with charge. That said, there are also some
  important differences between conductors and pipes that you should keep in
  mind:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p>Real water pipes can leak water. But, conductors cannot leak charge —
    the charged particles are held too tightly to the conductor to escape.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p>With a water pipe, the water flows <i>inside</i> the pipe. But, with
    metal conductors, the charge flows <i>throughout</i> the metal, not just
    inside of it. Unlike with a water pipe, with a conductor there is no
    outside part that keeps the charge in — they are simply held in by some
    inherent properties of the metal. That said, many wires will also have a
    plastic coating over them — this coating is an <i>insulator</i>, which
    means that it doesn't allow charge to flow through it. You'll see that the
    wires in your kit come in many different colors &mdash; these are the colors of
    the insulators that are wrapped around the metal wires.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

 <div class="section">
  <h1>Important Terminology</h1>
  <h2>Voltage, Current &amp; Resistance</h2>

  <p>Voltage, current &amp; resistance are the three most common measurements
  that can be made in an electrical circuit. We'll discuss each of these more
  in an upcoming tutorial, but for the next couple projects, it will be useful
  to have a rough idea of what these things are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Voltage:</strong> The difference in charge between two points in
    a circuit. The higher the voltage in an electrical circuit, the more
    "forcefully" the charge will flow from one end of the circuit to the other.
    In our water analogy, higher voltage would be analogous to a larger water
    pump that could push water through the pipes with increased pressure.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Current:</strong> The rate of flow of electric charge. The
    higher the current in an electrical circuit, the more charge that is
    flowing through the circuit in a specific period of time. In our water
    analogy, higher current would be analogous to a greater volume of water
    moving through the pipe.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Resistance:</strong> The amount that a circuit component reduces
    (resists) the flow of charge. The higher the resistance in an electrical circuit, the
    lower the rate of charge flowing through the circuit. In our water analogy,
    higher resistance would be analogous to making a section of the pipe
    narrower, which would restrict the amount of water that could flow through the
    system.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Power, Load &amp; Ground</h2>

  <p>Power, load &amp; ground are three common parts of any electrical
  circuit.</p>
  <div class="image_text" style="max-width: 400px;">
   <div>
    <img src="img/LightBulb-alt-trimmed-600.gif" alt="" style=
    "padding-bottom: 50px">
    <p style="font-size: 24px; left: -webkit-calc(50% - 35px); top: 40%;">
    Load</p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; right: 75%; bottom: 5%;">Power</p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; left: 75%; bottom: 4%;">Ground</p>
   </div>
  </div>

  <p>We'll discuss each of these more in an upcoming concept, but for the next
  couple projects, it will be useful to have a rough idea of what these things
  are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Power:</strong> This is generally the point of highest charge in
    an electrical circuit — for example, the positive terminal of your battery
    is typically what we consider the location of power in a circuit. In most
    of the projects we'll be doing, we'll refer to the power source as "3.3V"
    (since the power source we'll be using will be 3.3 volts). The power source
    provides the energy that makes the circuit do something useful.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Load:</strong> This is the part of an electrical circuit that
    actually uses the flow of charge to do something useful. In our circuits,
    these will be the components — things like lights, buttons, speaker, etc.
    The load uses the energy that the power source provides.</p>
   </li>
   <li>

    <p><strong>Ground:</strong> In an electrical circuit, ground is generally
    the point of lowest charge in the circuit. For example, in our lightbulb
    circuit above (and in most of the circuits we will build), the negative
    terminal of the battery is the point of lowest charge, and would be the
    <i>ground</i> point of the circuit. The reason we use the term "ground" is
    because in many electrical applications (like the electricity running
    through your house), the earth (the actual ground) is used as both our
    reference point of lowest charge and our physical point of attaching the
    electrical circuit — if you could look at the place where electricity comes
    into your house, you would see that there is a metal rod that connects this
    location to deep underground.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="info">
   <div>
    Grounding Yourself
   </div>
   <div>

    <p>In our Assembly Guide, we mentioned that you should "ground" yourself
    before touching electronic components. Now that you have a conceptual idea
    of what ground is, we can explain this further...</p>

    <p>Have you ever gotten a static shock by touching someone or something?
    Sometimes, electric charge builds up in your body. This charge is then
    released in the form of a static discharge (or shock) when you touch
    someone or something that has a different amount of charge. In other words,
    if there is a voltage difference between you and some object, and you touch
    that object, you'll get a shock. Once your body has discharged the excess
    charge, you don't get any more shocks — until, of course, you build up more
    charge.</p>

    <p>If you were to touch an electrical component when you have a charge
    built up in your body, that resulting static shock that you feel could very
    well be enough to zap the component and break it (we sometimes call this
    "frying the component.") So, to avoid frying any electrical components, we
    recommend that you discharge any excess charge in your body before touching
    the components.</p>

    <p>You can ground yourself by touching any piece of metal that is connected
    via some relatively direct path to the earth. Since all the electrical
    outlets in your house are connected to earth ground, you can generally
    ground yourself by touching the metal case of an electrical device that is
    plugged in. On the CREATOR Kit, you can touch the metal casing on any of
    the USB ports or the Ethernet port on the back of the Raspberry Pi —
    assuming the CREATOR Kit is plugged into a wall outlet (and thus having a
    path back to ground).</p>
