  <h2>The Introduction</h2>
  <h2>The Hardware</h2>

<p>The Minecraft API on the Raspberry Pi does not have any direct way to determine which direction Steve is facing.
This makes it essentially impossible to create code that allows you to modify the Minecraft world relative to what
you are seeing in front of you on the screen.  For example, without being able to programmatically tell what 
direction you're facing, you can't write a program that will do something directly in front of (or next to or behind)
your character.

<p>However, the RaspberrySTEM adds a couple new APIs that allows us to get the direction Steve is facing, and
therefore allows us to implement additional features that you couldn't get with the Minecraft API by itself.
Note that to use the functions below, we are doing some behind-the-scenes trickery with Minecraft, and because of
that, you are likely to see the screen briefly go blank (up to a half second) when you call these functions -- 
unfortunately, that's the result of what we have to do to get these APIs to work.

<h2>get_heading()</h2>

<p>The <code>get_heading()</code> function returns the angle you are pointing relative to the Z axis:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

while True:
	  print(control.get_heading(mc))
	  time.sleep(1)
</textarea></div>

<p>When we run this program, we'll see the screen go black briefly, about once a second.  This is because
we're continually calling the <code>get_heading()</code> function (in a real application, you likely won't
be calling the function very often, so this won't be a major issue).  In the Program Output window, we will
see the angle printed each time through the loop.  

<p>Try turning Steve around to face in different directions and watch the angle change.

<h2>get_direction()</h2>

<p>The <code>get_direction()</code> function returns provides two angles - the first angle is your heading, 
similar to the angle provided by <code>get_heading()</code>.  The second angle is the angle Steve is looking 
in the Y-axis (up or down).  This function uses a different method to determine the angle, which is not as 
precise as get_heading().  So, if you want a more precise heading (relative to just the Z-axis), use 
the <code>get_heading()</code> function:

<div class="code" data-firstline="1">
<div> </div>
<textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

while True:
	  print(control.get_direction(mc))
	  time.sleep(1)
</textarea></div>
