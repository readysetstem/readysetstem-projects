  <h1>Getting Direction</h1>

  <p>The Minecraft API on the Raspberry Pi doesn't have a direct way to
  determine which direction Steve is facing (this is just a limitation of
  the Minecraft API on this platform).  Unfortunately, this makes it essentially
  impossible to create code that allows you to modify the Minecraft world
  relative to what you are seeing in front of you on the screen. For example,
  without being able to programmatically tell what direction you're facing, you
  can't write a program that says to do something directly in front of (or next to,
  or behind) your character.</p>

  <p>For that reason, we've included several APIs in the Ready Set STEM API 
  that will allow us to get the direction Steve is facing, and will therefore allow 
  us to implement additional features that we couldn't get with the Minecraft API 
  alone. Note that to use the functions below, we are doing some behind-the-scenes
  trickery with Minecraft, and because of that, you will to see the
  screen briefly go blank (up to a half second) when you call these functions
  &mdash; that's the result of what we have to do to get these APIs
  to work.</p>
  <h2><code>get_heading()</code></h2>

  <p>The <code>get_heading()</code> function returns the angle you are pointing
  relative to the Z axis:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control
import time

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

while True:
          print(control.get_heading(mc))
          time.sleep(1)
</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>When we run this program, we'll see the screen go black briefly, about
  once a second. This is because we're continually calling the
  <code>get_heading()</code> function (in a real application, you likely won't
  be calling the function very often, so this won't be a major issue). In the
  Program Output window, we will see the angle printed each time through the
  loop.</p>

  <p>Try turning Steve around to face in different directions and watch the
  angle change.</p>
  <h2><code>get_direction()</code></h2>

  <p>The <code>get_direction()</code> function returns provides two angles -
  the first angle is your heading, similar to the angle provided by
  <code>get_heading()</code>. The second angle is the angle Steve is looking in
  the Y-axis (up or down). This function uses a different method to determine
  the angle, which is not as precise as get_heading(). So, if you want a more
  precise heading (relative to just the Z-axis), use the
  <code>get_heading()</code> function:</p>
  <div class="code" data-firstline="1">
   <textarea>
from rstem.mcpi import minecraft, control
import time

control.show()

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

while True:
          print(control.get_direction(mc))
          time.sleep(1)
</textarea>
  </div>
